        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all so I find myself with a bit of an issue. I have a Dell 3070 that I just install pop os on. Wanted to finally dive deeper into using Linux and liked what I saw.
 long story short I thought I had things set. Was performing the final restart after the install. And suddenly the bios could not find a bootable drive. No idea why, not sure what happened. I have a 500 gb SSD also in the machine so I thought welp. Did an install there, but this time I didn't encrypt the drive. 
 Any one have an idea on formatting the drive as it sits in this system? even during the install for some reason the drive would not show up as a possible install location. The bios does see it though.
 If you need more info let me know.

 I have a raspberry pi4 and i would like to use it from my tablet with termux.
  
SSH is not an option since the latency when opening vim + tmux is considerable(slow).
 I thought of using sshfs but it is not possible with termux.
 Although I don't like it, I also tried vscode (code-server) but it doesn't have support for ssh functionality
  
For now, configure my raspi to work with git-shell and use it as a kind of CI/CD server. But this is useful when you have concrete implementations in your code and not when you are developing it :( They know a better way to be able to use a raspi from termux

What do all of you think if linux start their own linux bios. A bios that can be flash to desktop and notebook and importantly open source. The bios will have no problem integration with linix kernel and distro.
 Whenever manufacturer only focus on making bios for windows integration the user like us have the freedom to flashing an open source bios based on linux to the system.

 We're looking for a headset for Zoom meetings ($30-$100) that's compatible with Ubuntu.
 We tried Microsoft Lifechat 3000 headphones, and while they were fine in Windows, Ubuntu absolutely refuses to connect to them.
 Can anyone recommend something?
 (I thought perhaps to only use headsets with 3.5mm, not USB, to make sure it's compatible... but if you know of any USB headsets, that would be better and more convenient.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy r/linux, I use FLOSS editors for my work like GIMP, Inkscape, FontForge, Krita, Blender and OpenShot on daily basis. But I would love to expand my toolkit and explore new options. I mean these tools work very well, just that I was looking to explore something niche and cool. Btw, I use Arch (MATE).
 What tools would you recommend for graphic and video editors that either similar to the popular ones or have unique features that the other don't have? Thank you for your answers. Have a great week.
