                <p>I&#x27;ve been looking at learning some RHEL or Suse lately and one thing that I&#x27;ve noticed, especially in the Suse world. Is that the default desktop for workstation/desktop variants is Gnome. Anyone know why this is? I could kind of understand with RHEL as Fedora is Gnome and they don&#x27;t have a large KDE history as far as I know, but Suse along with openSuse does a heap of KDE work and openSuse itself defaults to KDE as the standard desktop.
 It would also seem ideal to use KDE for enterprise desktops as Windows users would find the UI a lot more intuitive than Gnome&#x27;s.

                <p>So I&#x27;ve been using Windows 7 and 10 for as long as i can remember, its like my home. Unfortunately Microsoft is taking away that in 2025. I was going to go Windows 11 but my computer hardware is too old (Custom Build). So i decided to go with linux. I have been very hesitant because i want my games to work, to switch all my data over with no lose, and be comfortable with it. I understand change is hard and scary. I know there shouldn&#x27;t be much i should be scared of but it just keeps nagging me and i keep delaying the installation. I wanted to go with Pop OS but im not sure. I would like some support to help me move over, and if there is any tips i would gladly listen and take the advice.

                <p>Hello all so I find myself with a bit of an issue. I have a Dell 3070 that I just install pop os on. Wanted to finally dive deeper into using Linux and liked what I saw.
 long story short I thought I had things set. Was performing the final restart after the install. And suddenly the bios could not find a bootable drive. No idea why, not sure what happened. I have a 500 gb SSD also in the machine so I thought welp. Did an install there, but this time I didn&#x27;t encrypt the drive. 
 Any one have an idea on formatting the drive as it sits in this system? even during the install for some reason the drive would not show up as a possible install location. The bios does see it though.
 If you need more info let me know.

                <p>UPDATE I was able to get it changed! Thanks everyone
 A client has a vm that they refuse to get rid of and doesn&#x27;t know the password and we need to reset the password and need the iso to do so. Haven&#x27;t been able to find it online anywhere since it&#x27;s a million years old.

                <p>Hi all, I just got to experience the Linux OS through playing ard with virtual Ubuntu and kali linux and thought of getting a Linux OS laptop as I heard many good things about the Linux OS. Is that a good idea? 
 Just wondering , will familiarising myself with the Linux OS help me in entering a tech job, specifically, a cybersecurity job?

                <p>I know that the question does not go much with the theme of the group, but maybe someone knows an app or service that can help me.
 I have a raspberry pi4 and i would like to use it from my tablet with termux.
  
SSH is not an option since the latency when opening vim + tmux is considerable(slow).
 I thought of using sshfs but it is not possible with termux.
 Although I don&#x27;t like it, I also tried vscode (code-server) but it doesn&#x27;t have support for ssh functionality
  
For now, configure my raspi to work with git-shell and use it as a kind of CI/CD server. But this is useful when you have concrete implementations in your code and not when you are developing it :( They know a better way to be able to use a raspi from termux

                <p>In my humble opinion I think linux giving to much focus on the kernel and they success on the kernel development. What do all of you think if linux start their own linux bios. A bios that can be flash to desktop and notebook and importantly open source. The bios will have no problem integration with linix kernel and distro.
 Whenever manufacturer only focus on making bios for windows integration the user like us have the freedom to flashing an open source bios based on linux to the system.

                <p>Hi all, 
 YSK that there is a cool piece of software that offers most of the features of Evernote, and they have made a native version for Linux. Nice to see that they have done this, whereas Evernote simply cannot be arsed. 
 Check them out - notesnook.com

                <p>Hi folks!
 We&#x27;re looking for a headset for Zoom meetings ($30-$100) that&#x27;s compatible with Ubuntu.
 We tried Microsoft Lifechat 3000 headphones, and while they were fine in Windows, Ubuntu absolutely refuses to connect to them.
 Can anyone recommend something?
 (I thought perhaps to only use headsets with 3.5mm, not USB, to make sure it&#x27;s compatible... but if you know of any USB headsets, that would be better and more convenient.)

                <p>Howdy r/linux, I use FLOSS editors for my work like GIMP, Inkscape, FontForge, Krita, Blender and OpenShot on daily basis. But I would love to expand my toolkit and explore new options. I mean these tools work very well, just that I was looking to explore something niche and cool. Btw, I use Arch (MATE).
 What tools would you recommend for graphic and video editors that either similar to the popular ones or have unique features that the other don&#x27;t have? Thank you for your answers. Have a great week.

                <p>I&#x27;m just now learning how to use Linux and I&#x27;m finding it more helpful to get accustomed to the terminal by trying to install useful programs for customizing Linux. Is there anything out there thats pretty cool that I should download that would help me do more customization? I had to download something just to set up separate wallpapers for my dual monitors.
 I&#x27;m using the Ubuntu distro.
