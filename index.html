                <p>Straight across or down, that’s the proverbial order for user controls on a screen. Like a list of menu items. But what if we change that to a more fluid layout with bends, curves, and nooks? We can pull it …

                <p>I have a story to share about how i started using linux, it was actually the first os that i used. I remember that i started with linux when i was around 6-7! it was in 2013 (yes i’m a zoomer) and i remember i used ubuntu 12.10 because i got an old laptop from my grandparents and dad installed it until we buy a new windows license (the computer had windows xp that just broke). Dad was teaching me some shell commands and helping me repair stuff that broke on it. all i can say is that i have learned a lot of stuff and that i’m grateful that i started on linux. i have used it until this day dualbooted with windows (for some games not supporting wine)

                <p>I have heard some people use wm&#x27;s such as xmonad or i3 mainly due to multi monitor support. However, is there any advantages to using a wm on a laptop? The screens are usually small and opening windows side to side would only make the windows smaller and smaller. 
 Not to mention having to configure all the F keys to actually lower brightness and volume has been a pain in my experience. Am I using these wrong? What are your thoughts?

                <p>My personal choice would be Thunderbird. Coupled with Lightning and TBSync extensions it becomes a full drop-in replacement for Outlook. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it made me completely forget about its proprietary counterpart, yet over the years it has been struggling to see continued development. I am interested in knowing other FOSS projects which you find particularly valuable or that you personally support on a ongoing basis.

                <p>Hey all.
 As per the title, I have taken on a project of creating a small introduction booklet for my works (we sell refurbished PC&#x27;s, or at least we do now myself and my colleague are there, the place used to just sell clothes, furniture and bric-a-brac), where most of the customers have never even heard of Linux let alone used it.
 Any PC we sell that is below a comfortable, responsive install of Windows 10 gets a lightly customised version of BunsenLabs installed on it. While it isn&#x27;t the most pretty or user-friendly Linux out there it is one of the lightest. Being light weight was a huge factor in deciding what flavour we went for as the main machine criteria is a Core 2 Duo/Quad CPU with 4GB RAM and a 160GB HDD. Q4OS with the Trinity desktop was another consideration but it turned out…</p>

                <p>I know Android is a very different &quot;distro&quot;, but considering it runs on the Linux kernel and has some similarities, I was thinking how big of an effort companies would need to make to port their apps. Would it require major code rewrites or just some library substitutions? Is it easier to go from Android to Linux, Windows to Linux, or Windows to Android (or the other way around)? Note I&#x27;m talking about native apps, no VM or compatibility layer involved. This question sprang to my mind after I noticed some companies maintain 6 different versions of the same app. 
 I only know how to program OS-agnostic CLI programs yet.

                <p>As a life long windows user, im very familiar with the layout of Windows. I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of videos about the linux OS and have been really interested in using it (Deepin) as my daily driver. I use FL Studio as my DAW of choice. I&#x27;ve used it for years and absolutely love it, but it does not work on Linux. Is it worth switching to Linux? or should i just update to windows. I dont know if this is the best place to ask a question like this as i may get some biased responses, so please try to stay open-minded.

                <p>Received a job offer/interview for having a background in linux and an active DOD security clearance. Problem is this is a mid level job opportunity and im at best entry level for linux network experience. Is this a dumb dream of a 19yr old or should I bite the bullet and reach 4 it. I have studied for linux plus, daily drive debian 10.10 and am fairly versed in setting up CISCO routers and switches via command line. But i dont want to promise anything out of my scope or skill set. 
 There aren&#x27;t many applicants maybe 3 and it couldn&#x27;t hurt to reply back 
 a career in Linux is the dream any job in IT is the goal
 Any current linux system admins out there ?

                <p>Not long ago, as some of you may be aware, Adobe purchased Allegorithmic. Which meant that they now had Substance 3D, an overall excellent and top of the class tool for 3D work and CGI. This suite was, to my knowledge, always native for Linux with no issues.
 Will this change as Adobe has fully rebranded Substance Suite into its messy arsenal of some of the best software in each field? From their FAQ on their official website, Linux builds are not available through Adobe&#x27;s subscription, only available on Steam&#x27;s perpetual version.
  
Linux builds of the Substance apps aren’t available via Individual Adobe Substance 3D subscriptions. At this point the Linux version is only available on Steam for Substance Painter &amp; Substance Designer. For Teams &amp; Enterprise plans on Adobe.com, please contact [sales@substance3d.com](mailto:sales@substance3d.com).
  
I won&#x27;t be naive, they won&#x27;t sell any more perpetual licenses from now on. Does this signify the end of practical, efficient and stable 3D texture development on Linux? I love Blender and I use it for work, but there is no practical, affordable and high quality alternative to Substance 3D. Blender just doesn&#x27;t cut it.
 It seems like a pointless move to remove Linux support, but oh well.

                <p>Today I wondered if I could change the colors of the progress bar apt shows when installing/removing packages.
 Turns out, you can, and it&#x27;s only kinda fiddly.
 Man pages have been unhelpful in this, and the only information I could find on this is from when Ubuntu 14.04 was the latest, so apt may have changed slightly since then, but I got things working how I want.
 You&#x27;ll need to create a file at /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99progressbar, (permissions 644) and add the following:
 Dpkg::Progress-Fancy &quot;1&quot;; Dpkg::Progress-Fancy::Progress-Bg &quot;%1b[**m&quot;; Dpkg::Progress-Fancy::Progress-Fg &quot;%1b[**m&quot;; 
 Where ** is an ANSI color code number. For example, for white text on blue background, I used 37 for Bg and 44 for Fg.
 These seem to be reversed from what I thought they should be, according to this ANSI color code table. But I&#x27;m just fumbling my way through this anyhow.
 Anybody know if there are any more options for making apt prettier?

                <p>Title explains it all. I&#x27;m going to create a terminal file manager just for fun, so if you have any ideas for features or anything, write it below. So far I have 2 criteria: 
  
Must be fast (~1-2ms startup)
 Should show file previews
  
Should I write it in: Rust or C? What other features would a user like to see?

                <p>I recently distro hopped to linux and I am wondering, which desktop envirement looks the best by default such as KDE, XFCE, Gnome, Cinnamon or maybe even some other envirement that look good. Personally I decided on XFCE due to its simplicity as well as its customizability but what have you chosen. But I know XFCE isn&#x27;t very pretty out of the box on some installations.

                <p>I&#x27;ve been looking at learning some RHEL or Suse lately and one thing that I&#x27;ve noticed, especially in the Suse world. Is that the default desktop for workstation/desktop variants is Gnome. Anyone know why this is? I could kind of understand with RHEL as Fedora is Gnome and they don&#x27;t have a large KDE history as far as I know, but Suse along with openSuse does a heap of KDE work and openSuse itself defaults to KDE as the standard desktop.
 It would also seem ideal to use KDE for enterprise desktops as Windows users would find the UI a lot more intuitive than Gnome&#x27;s.

                <p>So I&#x27;ve been using Windows 7 and 10 for as long as i can remember, its like my home. Unfortunately Microsoft is taking away that in 2025. I was going to go Windows 11 but my computer hardware is too old (Custom Build). So i decided to go with linux. I have been very hesitant because i want my games to work, to switch all my data over with no lose, and be comfortable with it. I understand change is hard and scary. I know there shouldn&#x27;t be much i should be scared of but it just keeps nagging me and i keep delaying the installation. I wanted to go with Pop OS but im not sure. I would like some support to help me move over, and if there is any tips i would gladly listen and take the advice.

                <p>Hello all so I find myself with a bit of an issue. I have a Dell 3070 that I just install pop os on. Wanted to finally dive deeper into using Linux and liked what I saw.
 long story short I thought I had things set. Was performing the final restart after the install. And suddenly the bios could not find a bootable drive. No idea why, not sure what happened. I have a 500 gb SSD also in the machine so I thought welp. Did an install there, but this time I didn&#x27;t encrypt the drive. 
 Any one have an idea on formatting the drive as it sits in this system? even during the install for some reason the drive would not show up as a possible install location. The bios does see it though.
 If you need more info let me know.

                <p>UPDATE I was able to get it changed! Thanks everyone
 A client has a vm that they refuse to get rid of and doesn&#x27;t know the password and we need to reset the password and need the iso to do so. Haven&#x27;t been able to find it online anywhere since it&#x27;s a million years old.

                <p>Hi all, I just got to experience the Linux OS through playing ard with virtual Ubuntu and kali linux and thought of getting a Linux OS laptop as I heard many good things about the Linux OS. Is that a good idea? 
 Just wondering , will familiarising myself with the Linux OS help me in entering a tech job, specifically, a cybersecurity job?

                <p>I know that the question does not go much with the theme of the group, but maybe someone knows an app or service that can help me.
 I have a raspberry pi4 and i would like to use it from my tablet with termux.
  
SSH is not an option since the latency when opening vim + tmux is considerable(slow).
 I thought of using sshfs but it is not possible with termux.
 Although I don&#x27;t like it, I also tried vscode (code-server) but it doesn&#x27;t have support for ssh functionality
  
For now, configure my raspi to work with git-shell and use it as a kind of CI/CD server. But this is useful when you have concrete implementations in your code and not when you are developing it :( They know a better way to be able to use a raspi from termux

                <p>In my humble opinion I think linux giving to much focus on the kernel and they success on the kernel development. What do all of you think if linux start their own linux bios. A bios that can be flash to desktop and notebook and importantly open source. The bios will have no problem integration with linix kernel and distro.
 Whenever manufacturer only focus on making bios for windows integration the user like us have the freedom to flashing an open source bios based on linux to the system.

                <p>Hi all, 
 YSK that there is a cool piece of software that offers most of the features of Evernote, and they have made a native version for Linux. Nice to see that they have done this, whereas Evernote simply cannot be arsed. 
 Check them out - notesnook.com

                <p>Hi folks!
 We&#x27;re looking for a headset for Zoom meetings ($30-$100) that&#x27;s compatible with Ubuntu.
 We tried Microsoft Lifechat 3000 headphones, and while they were fine in Windows, Ubuntu absolutely refuses to connect to them.
 Can anyone recommend something?
 (I thought perhaps to only use headsets with 3.5mm, not USB, to make sure it&#x27;s compatible... but if you know of any USB headsets, that would be better and more convenient.)

                <p>Howdy r/linux, I use FLOSS editors for my work like GIMP, Inkscape, FontForge, Krita, Blender and OpenShot on daily basis. But I would love to expand my toolkit and explore new options. I mean these tools work very well, just that I was looking to explore something niche and cool. Btw, I use Arch (MATE).
 What tools would you recommend for graphic and video editors that either similar to the popular ones or have unique features that the other don&#x27;t have? Thank you for your answers. Have a great week.

                <p>I&#x27;m just now learning how to use Linux and I&#x27;m finding it more helpful to get accustomed to the terminal by trying to install useful programs for customizing Linux. Is there anything out there thats pretty cool that I should download that would help me do more customization? I had to download something just to set up separate wallpapers for my dual monitors.
 I&#x27;m using the Ubuntu distro.
