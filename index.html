                <p>An Alternative to Anti-Cheat (and much more) -- Giving Enclaves another chance
 I think I&#x27;ve found a worthwhile alternative to software anti-cheat (that also would work well on Linux, without privacy, freedom or security concerns)
 I&#x27;ve played games since my early childhood. At some point in time, bots/cheating started to become a major issue in all online games. For example, an early MMORPG went through an era it almost collapsed (and had to reinvent several core mechanics) to get around cheats and unintended automation. Eventually, they moved to BattleEye and seem to be mostly under control (although the game, called Tibia, was severely altered to make most cheating literally either impossible or built-into the official client).
 I&#x27;ve become convinced the best solution would not be a sof…</p>

                <p>we should not recommend total beginners, ones looking to use Linux for the first time, to gauge the usability or experience via virtual machines nor live USB-booted sessions. the VM and USB experience is not representative of the Linux experience, as it is, for example, difficult to gauge performance discrepancies, address realistic problems such as hardware constraints and compatibility issues, build familiarity with the patterns involved in commonly encountered problems, and workaround the lack of popular software or industry standard software.
 to illuminate on one of these examples, consider a hobbyist photographer seeking to transition to Linux. it is unrealistic for them to boot up a USB session and install a photo editing application, import photos, and gauge whether the said application is an appropriate replacement all in one go. similarly, if one used a VM, they would have to go through the trouble of understanding what a VM is, and how to transfer files between it and and the host machine. pertaining to both methods, there will inevitably be a penalty in performance.
 for the above reasons, it is best to dual boot (where possible) or fully install a beginner-friendly distribution to gauge whether Linux as an OS is for you. using a VM or live session go gauge an OS with an different paradigm is inaccurate and can give a false impression, whether for better or worse. with that said, VMs and live sessions still have their uses in sampling, but they are more suited for experienced users who can take advantage of the low overhead cost of sampling different distributions by recognizing the differences in UI/UX/philosophies between distributions.

                <p>EDIT: I am talking about tiling window managers
 I have only really used awesome for an extended amount of time but have tried out a few others. I have been thinking about making a wm myself (mostly for learning), and I thought it would make an interesting discussion here. What is the best/worst thing of each wm? What can be learned from them?
 The best things about awesome in my opinion is how you can move the windows with the mouse. Its such a simple thing, but I havent seen any other wm do this. Basically in other wms you make a window floating by holding mod and dragging, but in awesome you just drag the window through the stack. (and ye I know youre not supposed to use your mouse in a wm, but its so simple to just drag the window where you want, and not fuuck up the entire layout by doing so). Also lua is a very nice language and its nice to not have to recompile the wm after changes.

                <p>Sorry but I couldn&#x27;t find a daily/weekly thread. I&#x27;m asking this boring question because soon I will be making small changes to my setup and PC and with Win 11 around the corner I was checking that out as well. While it seems really cool and all it also gave me flashbacks of Win 8 Metro UI which I despised very very much so. So I kinda started on thinking about alternatives.
 I&#x27;m primarily a gamer but I also use office software and media creation softwares everyday and also some pirated software. Now alternatives are fine and all but pirated software is a bit of a question mark? I don&#x27;t even know if that&#x27;s a thing on Linux.
 My guess is that my day to day usage would probably not be affected by it. But I was also wondering, if I will be facing any performance issues. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t really have a PC which I can confidently say 20-30-40% performance drop wouldn&#x27;t effect me, it would effect me very bad. So that&#x27;s my second main concern.
 Leaving Microsoft&#x27;s ecosystem and privacy/security issues are like at the bottom of the list for me if I have to be honest. I&#x27;m one of those people that don&#x27;t really have sensitive information and I know what I&#x27;m doing so I never had any major security issues either.
 So yeah in short, I&#x27;m wondering what will I have to leave behind and how much of a performance hit I will take on things which I bring with me.
 Edit: Thanks everyone for very detailed responses. I actually learned a lot about the differences.

                <p>just stumbled upon this pdf reader and wanted to share it!! a couple features i find particularly helpful: &quot;portal&quot; opens a separate view of a figure on the side for reference, which is probably the best mimic of &quot;flipping back and forth between pages on a physical printout of a paper&quot;. &quot;search reference&quot; and &quot;go to reference&quot;, which enables quick access to referenced google scholar searches, referenced figures, and a &quot;website for downloading articles 🤔🤔&quot; (not sure if the site can be named on reddit)

 It&#x27;s a simple bash script I made a few days ago when I had difficulty using the world-clock app on my phone. I don&#x27;t know if something like this already exists. And yeah, I had to include all the timezones as an array because I didn&#x27;t find any timedatectl --list-timezones equivalent on non-systemd distros and on phones.
 I admit it&#x27;s a bit slow and not written in an intuitive manner, so I could use some help.
 Peace!

                <p>Hi there!
 New to linux but im learning lots on my journey! Im working on a new project, and im not 100 percent on the nuance of the OS yet.. was hoping to see what yall think?
 The current project is creating a safe space (edit::from viruses and malware on the main os windows) on my computer for my banking needs and what not. Something that has a zero percent chance of transfering potential malware from my main pc.. the options im currently considering are: Bootable password protected usb or virtual machine.
 Now.. i like the idea of the bootable usb because i can litterally disconect it from the pc when im not using it and correct me if im wrong but if the os is password protected/encrypted then my main os (windows) has no ability to write to the seperate harddrive while its plugged in and in use..
 The other option ive been discovering is quite popular among the linux community is via virtual machine! Im obviously hesitant on this option because im still learning about them.. but this seems easier and makes more sense to me.. that being said, i dont have a great understanding on whether or not my source os (windows) will have communication/installation privileges with the linux os on the VM because really the VM creates its own space on the same drive..
 Totally open to other ideas as well! Id just love to hear what you guys would do here!

                <p>Recently I&#x27;ve started using the spm password manager.
 it works fine, and I really like it, but im getting freaked out about the question of how to back my stuff up?
 would I just move the &quot;.gpg&quot;s into a usb drive? is it that simple?

                <p>Does anyone know of any type of graphic equalizer where the EQ settings can be changed without directly interacting with the user interface?
 I&#x27;m working on a media server where I want to be able to have specific EQ settings on a per album basis, so when an album is played, I want to automatically change the EQ to use the specific settings I&#x27;ve saved for that album, then play it.
 I know there are headless media players out there (mpd, for example), but I can&#x27;t find an equalizer that can do this. I&#x27;ve done it with a Windows-based media server I wrote a long time ago because Winamp had a built-in equalizer, and someone created a plugin where you could completely control Winamp over an HTTP interface, including the equalizer&#x27;s settings.
 Speaking of mpd, are there other headless media players I should be looking at for linux? I don&#x27;t really need mpd&#x27;s database functionality, as I have my own database.

The Internet has unleashed upon billions of people unprecedented economic and political freedom, as well as powerful means of control and domination. Yet, the vast majority of us are oblivious to its inner workings.

                <p>Hello there,
 I am currently a sys admin in training and wanted to learn more about file systems. Currently I used ext4 on my main workstation and zfs on my home nas. I also know of xfs, btrfs and ufs for Unix-like operating systems, but still fairly unsure about when to choose each file system, ie. their strenghts and weaknesses.
 While I have googled already on this topic, I wanted to ask for a second opinion on this one.

                <p>I’ve tried probably 10 different distros with my 4K monitor. Fedora, Ubuntu, PopOS, Mint, Vanilla Arch etc. 
 Every single distro has horrible performance once fractional scaling is enabled. Moving windows around is jittery and looks almost like screen tearing but it’s not tearing. At 100% or 200% everything’s fine. 150% and it’s bad. 
 Basically can we just not have 4K monitors?

                <p>I think we all pretty much know about the big players like Canonical, RedHat and Suse. But what other open source businesses are there? I&#x27;d like to start my own open source software business. It would help to know who else has succeeded with providing OSS AND turned a healthy profit so I can model their success.

                <p>Sir Clive was a character and a visionary. A member of MENSA he developed the first digital pocket calculators, watches and portable TVs. He became famous for bringing an era of cheap computers to every home with his ZX80 &amp; 81 and the eponymous ZX Spectrum. He later went up markets and tried to make a business machine called the Sinclair QL , or Quantum Leap.
 What you might not know, though, is Linus first learned to program on a Sinclair QL and in fact inspired him to think of multitasking and doing things himself. 
 So with the passing of this larger than life character we should give thanks to his inspiration, not only to 1000&#x27;s of bedroom programmers who would kickstart the computer games industry and some are still riding high in it now, but also to the serious programmers like Linus, who, if he did not have a QL itch to scratch might never have written Linux at all. 
 RIP Uncle Clive. Your legacy is evident.

                <p>I made this web application for simply monitoring servers status at a glance. It uses Spring Boot, MongoDB and acquires the data from a shell script that runs on the crontab. Check it out for self-hosting or using the cloud version at https://sssm.app. You can also contribute to the GitHub at https://github.com/fbocolowski/sssm.

                <p>Can we pleeeeease make it so the authors of those posts at least have to add some text to the main body of that message saying what that package does, possibly even some info about the update? 
 These posts just feel so low-effort and, unless you are a linux pro, they are only spam which is ignored. I can absolutely imagine that these posts push people away (ive considered un-joining because of the pointless spam a few times myself...)
 Much love, a linux newbie

                <p>Introduction
 Hello,
 Recently, I&#x27;ve been getting into KDE (and Linux in general). I came across this theme I really loved, called, simply, &quot;Breeze-Honey&quot;, and I really loved it! Now, there is enough available information on the internet to prove this theme&#x27;s past existence. The issue is, the theme itself has been wiped off the face of the internet entirely. The theme is split into 2 seperate branches; Breeze-Honey-Dark, and Breeze-Honey-Light.
 Search Index (archived from Pling.com), and screenshots
 Here are the 3 archived search pages showing every relevant result for this theme.

 Here are a few screenshots I could gather showing the theme off in all its glory.

                <p>How to Ask a Stupid Question
 &quot;There&#x27;s no such thing as a stupid question...&quot;
 A stupid question is any question that you feel stupid asking. Why do we feel stupid? Sometimes it&#x27;s because we feel like we should know something. More often, it&#x27;s because we don&#x27;t want to look stupid by asking a question. You know what, it&#x27;s perfectly okay to ask stupid questions. I&#x27;ll say it again, it&#x27;s okay to ask stupid questions. The key to asking stupid questions is to ask them intelligently. No, that&#x27;s not a contradiction in terms. Asking stupid questions intelligently does two things. First, it gives you confidence and you feel less stupid. Secondly, it prepares you for the answer.

                <p>Hey Guys,
 I am A Computer Science Student who has a lot of interest in CS.
 I have learned quite a few languages (logic is clear grabbing language was not a big deal).
 I like to study CS in depth by knowing how it works and all.
 I have learned JAVA,c,c++,Python,MongoDB,GIT,bash
 I have been using the Linux system for a long time won&#x27;t say I am a Linux pro but not a newbie too. 
 ​
 Doing random stuff coding made me realized m not doing anything to make the community grow or everything I do makes me feels wasteful.
 ​
 I felt I should start contributing to Opensource or Linux kernel Building. I searched a lot on the internet found myself a bit confused so If you guys can help me by telling me where should I start?

                <p>print allows you to print to USB, parallel, and serial printers. It uses the generic/text-only driver, so no images or fonts or text size. Ensure your printer supports this mode in order to print. It also supports network printers over AppSocket/port 9100, no IPP support or anything too fancy. You need write access to the printer device file in order to print to it, so for parallel printers for example, you must be a member of group lp. Written in node.js so make sure you have node.js installed and in the path. Why did I write it? To learn how printers work. Download at https://gist.github.com/thecoder08/685297015ee6bc7cff681dddeff71783
 To try it out, save the raw file in the path and chmod +x it. It should be accessible via the print command. To use it, run the command (as root if necessary) and enter the device type, IP address/device, and file to print. It should automatically print after you enter the document name.
 Edit: you guys seem to hate it so I’m deleting it. It was just for fun and not intended for real use which you guys can’t seem to wrap your heads around. Also can someone tell me why node.js is bad beside it not being installed by default? It’s not just for server side use and is almost as versatile as python. That’s my opinion anyway, feel free to downvote if my opinion isn’t exactly the same as yours. (Sarcasm if you are too dumb to tell)

                <p>If manjaro is the version of Arch linux that is easier to install and comes with some things preinstalled.
 Is there a &quot;manjaro&quot; for gentoo? If so what is the best one?
 ​
 I found this Clover OS but I am not sure if that&#x27;s what I am looking for.
 ​
 I wanted to experiment with gentoo but I am afraid of the time it might cost me . Also is portage (package manager) like pacman or apt-get? Does it have many softwares and can I make packages for it from non package binaries like in pacman?

                <p>If you ever need to boot into the system setup, don&#x27;t worry about remembering what the key combination was, or missing the timing to hit the button during the POST screen. 
 Just run this command as root and the system will reboot and get into the setup:
 ​
 # systemctl reboot --firmware-setup
 ​
 This only works on systems with EFI technology and not running in CSM mode - anything x86 that is less than 5 years old should be like that.

                <p>[UPDATED FROM 10.0 TO 11.0!]
 Hi everyone. I&#x27;ve written some instructions and scripts to build LFS (Linux From Scratch), version 11.0, as simply as possible (I know, not that simple, but anyway). It&#x27;s basically a super summarized version of the LFS book.
 You can check the instructions and get the scripts from my GitHub repository: https://github.com/luisgbm/lfs-scripts
 Key points:
  
First, this guide does not replace reading the whole LFS book. I highly recommend that you read it at least once. Only then you should use the automation scripts provided here.
 The whole process is run inside VirtualBox.
 You need two hard disks attached to your VM (one for the host, one for receiving the LFS build).
 Most steps will be executed via Shell scripts (there are four of them).
 Some steps need to be manually run.
 At the end, you will be able to create a separate VM and boot from it directly.
  
Hope you enjoy it, and feel free to send me feedback.

                <p>I&#x27;m currently learning to use linux without using the GUI like you do on Windows/macOS. But I ran into a problem I couldn&#x27;t find the answer for.
 I want to get the sum of the size of all the files in a directory.
 to list those files:
 ls -l | grep &#x27;drwx*&#x27; -v 
 To get the size you normally use &quot;du&quot; but I can&#x27;t find a way to get it to work. Does anyone has an idea how?

 If you have a project that fits into these requirements then consider filling a form to get funding on https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aqhk4tfU_ggVb6-6EtEXNJX57nfYzvS7HBzcQmkoahc/edit (sorry for G$! Working on replacing that with nextcloud as soon as i can!)

                <p>Hi Linuxy people!
 I use Openbox as my WM, despite its age and despite I know it has little development going on. However, I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with it for years now. Small footprint and highly customizable. However.
 I saw Openbox was no longer offered as a community edition on the Manjaro download page, and decided to take a look at the latest patch notes, and they are ancient.
 Hence, I started to wonder if people still use Openbox at all. Also it got me wondering if I should consider transitioning into something more modern.
 So let me know if you use Openbox. Or have used Openbox and why you switched to something else.Or if you have suggestions to what WM or DE that would be a suitable replacement, that is welcome too!

                <p>This script uses various methods to check the installation date. Some distros have a way of checking the install date, but unfortunately there&#x27;s no universal way. If your distro is unsupported, it will fall back to using the filesystem creation date, which may or may not be accurate.
 For Arch Linux users it&#x27;s in the AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/install-date-git/
 For Gentoo users it&#x27;s in my overlay: https://github.com/alicela1n/alicela1n-gentoo-overlay

                <p>Browse through Dribbble or Behance, and you’ll find designers using a simple technique to add texture to an image: noise. Adding noise makes otherwise solid colors or smooth gradients, such as shadows, more realistic. But despite designers’ affinity for texture, …

                <p>It seems like many users of the Linux, *BSD, and FOSS communities in general have something of a beef with Oracle. I&#x27;ve seen people say off-the-cuff things like, &quot;too bad Oracle hates their customers&quot; and the somewhat surprising &quot;I&#x27;d rather sell everything I have and give the money directly to Microsoft than be forced to use any product from Oracle&quot; (damn!).
 ...What did Oracle do, exactly? Can someone fill me in? All I know about them is that they bought out Sun and make their own CentOS-equivalent Linux distribution (which apparently works quite well, but which some Linux users seem wary of despite being free and open source).
 For the record, I&#x27;m not zealously pro-Oracle or anything, but I don&#x27;t know enough about anything they&#x27;ve done wrong to be anti-Oracle, either. What&#x27;s the deal?

                <p>I&#x27;ve been 100% on linux since 2002, when I took my Unix skill and brought it into my home on OpenSuse. In 2005 or so, I moved to Ubuntu. Then when Ubuntu went to Unity (what a mess), I went to Mint and Cinnamon. And there I&#x27;ve remained to this day.
 In the last week, I&#x27;ve had 3 separate conversations where someone suggested that I really &quot;ought to&quot; leave the &quot;beginner&quot; environment of Linux Mint. All 3 suggested that I should move to either Arch or Manjaro (if I didn&#x27;t want to do the full install path of Arch). When I pressed for details, they all mentioned &quot;rolling releases&quot; and &quot;latest versions&quot;. But, aside from a snarky &quot;it&#x27;s a grown up&#x27;s OS&quot;, no one really gave me a reason that seems all that compelling.
 So I&#x27;m asking the brain trust, is there a compelling reason for me to distrohop? To what? And why? What would I gain from moving to Arch, or Manjaro, or Gentoo, or LFS, or whatever... aside from just learning a new way to do things.
 My machine is reasonably modern and can run whatever DE I throw at it. I use it for docs, browsing, VMs, listening to music, torrenting and generally fooling around.

                <p>Open source maintenance is difficult. I always see a lot of people complaining about a problem with an app which simply uninstalls it and also complains that it&#x27;s no good.
 We are a community. There is no big company that orchestrates all of this and I also know that not everyone is a developer, but believe me, the simple fact that you and me report a bug, we are already contributing.
 I was once talking to the developer of a great open source project. I asked him why &quot;X&quot; feature was not in the project and his answer was simple:
 Because no one has proposed to develop it yet.
 Please if you can report any bugs you find and be part of this great community of people who help every great project always be even better. 
 Peace.

                <p>I just wanted to give huge shout out for these two projects, DotDevelop (fork of MonoDevelop, which is a dead project cause of Microsoft), and AvalonStudio. Both of them aims to bring us Linux users the joy of using full IDE like Visual Studio. They are slowly progressing, so if you can contribute to projects in any way, even with just testing, give them a shot !

                <p>When I switched to Ubuntu 12.04 from Windows back in 2012, the Gutterprint driver for my Canon printer just sucked, it was feature incomplete, so I downloaded and installed the Canon Linux drivers from their website and I&#x27;ve been using the same drivers since 12.04 to 18.04, however, when I upgraded to 20.04, the drivers refused to install due to compatibility issues and the Gutterprint drivers still sucked, so I was forced to download the Canon drivers for Windows and run my printer via WinXP on Virtualbox to print. I even tried to install the Windows drivers on WINE, it didn&#x27;t work.
 So what&#x27;s stopping the development of a compatibility layer for Windows device drivers to run on Linux exactly?
 The ability to run Windows device drivers would be a great help for Windows users transitioning to Linux without the worry of their hardware being incompatible with the OS, because lets face it, Linux&#x27;s market share is so low that companies like Canon, Adobe, etc will never outright support Linux.

                <p>I’ve been playing with Weston. Pretty nice and minimal floating Wayland window compositor and relatively easy to configure. You can create launchers in weston.ini which you can connect to wofi or another application launcher such as jgmenu or bemenu, your web browser, your terminal, network manager, logout utility, etc. They show up in the top taskbar.
 It seems to be often overlooked but is quite light on resources . Anyone else using this as a daily driver?

                <p>Hi all,
 Have some of you tried CliFM, the command line file manager? If so, what&#x27;s good about it? Where it fails? What could be added or improved? I&#x27;m the author, btw, and I&#x27;m looking for feedback to make this project better. Any suggestion, idea or comment will be really appreciated.
 Thank you very much in advance!

                <p>You can try vaapi acceleration on latest Firefox too on linux.
 Previously we use this method with xorg and im currently on wayland and to my surprise it still work.
 On Firefox stable go to about:config and set :
 Before that we need to start firefox with :
 MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND&#x3D;1
 Then go to about:config
 media.ffmpeg.vaapi-drm-display.enabled to true media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled to true
 media.ffvpx.enabled to false
 Then install firefox add on &quot;h264ify&quot; for youtube. Then play some video and watch the cpu usage got drop or still high.
 And add addon &quot;h264ify-embed-fix&quot; for hardware acceleration other than youtube website eg vimeo.
 Firefox getting better and better with their latest release. Cant wait for &quot;WebGpu&quot; to be implement on firefox stable.
 Anyway once everything work you can remove h264yify addon. After that monitor again the cpu usage when playing youtube video whether it drop or increase with h264yify disable.
 Tested on Firefox 90.0. Intel graphic and Amdgpu. Wayland Kde plasma. Manjaro linux.

                <p>I&#x27;ve just recently started using RSS, specifically the command line Newsboat client, and I am really enjoying it. It is a great way to check up on my favorite websites, without having to open my web browser. Its fast, efficient, extensible, and I can&#x27;t get distracted :)
 However, I&#x27;ve realized I only know a handful of good sites, for instance lukesmith.xyz \_(&#x60;~&#x60;)_/ or LWN.net, and of course the Lunduke Journal. So what sites do you follow? It doesn&#x27;t matter if its news or blog.

                <p>I believe acss.io is the first usage of “Atomic CSS” where the point of it is to be a compiler. You write CSS like this:
&lt;div class&#x3D;&quot;C(#fff) P(20px)&quot;text

And it will generate CSS like:
.C\(\#333\) {
  color: #333;

                <p>We might leave a text input unstyled. We might leave a link unstyled. Even a button. But checkboxes… we don’t leave them alone. That’s why styling checkboxes never gets old.

                <p>I&#x27;ve been using FOSS software for a long time. I&#x27;m not a developer, nor am I rich, or affiliated with anything I mention below. I&#x27;ve just started to realize that the best way to show your appreciation for stuff you use, even if it&#x27;s free, is to pay whatever you can. Especially now, maybe more than ever, it all helps. Even if the amounts are small, you&#x27;re communicating your care and appreciation for someone who&#x27;s done a good job, and is making your life easier. And when I say pay &quot;what you can&quot;, be honest with yourself - how much is the thing really helping you, and what could you give without noticing too much? Or even do without something that you could really do without, and pass on the couple of bucks a month? I&#x27;m not blowing smoke. I like Calibre for ebooks, and Geary for email. Wikipedia &amp; archive.org are essential. So I pay them all what I can, every month. If it happens that I can&#x27;t anymore, well, I&#x27;ll just stop &amp; try to start again when things are better.

                <p>Hey guys, i am a Brazilian college student that its just trying to learn more about Linux, i setup one jellyfin (plex similar) server in my home and i wanted that my website subdomain redirected to my home public ip (i know this is kind unsafe), but my ISP change my ip once a week or two, so to automate this process i make this script. 
 This is my first shell script and first github repo, and i am very excited to share with you guys.
 Thanks a lot for everything, i learned a lot from this community.

                <p>Recently I&#x27;ve seen multiple posts about an unofficial Manjaro spin having replaced Firefox with Vivaldi by default and for some reason it&#x27;s apparently big news and people here hate it.
 IMO Vivaldi is actually a good browser that cares about your privacy as much as Firefox does and there&#x27;s no bigger difference in the privacy matter other than that some parts of Vivaldi are closed source.
 Also wanted to point out Manjaro (the official version) has always had Steam preinstalled, which is also closed source, and apparently no one cares about that, yet including Vivaldi in an offspin preinstalled somehow makes big news?

                <p>Hey everyone!
 ​
 I&#x27;m thinking about trying out Linux but I&#x27;m legally blind and thus rely on a screen reader for computer use. I&#x27;d like to hear some opinions on Orca from those of you who&#x27;ve tried it/used it extensively, since as far as I know, my current screen reader of choice (NVDA) is only compatible with Windows. How well does it handle programs such as Tor, Thunderbird, LibreOffice or VLC?
 ​
 Thanks for the answers in advance!

                <p>Something that holds me back from committing to most distros is the fact that I don&#x27;t know if I can trust them with my privacy and personal information. 
 There are so many out there, and I can&#x27;t help but feel like a few of them should not be trusted. I could just be paranoid, but I&#x27;ve been a lot more privacy-focused lately so this is always on my mind. 
 How do you tell whether or not you can trust a distro?

                <p>Edit: also shout out to the guys down below really helping me find other solutions here. still wont solve everything but its a start.
 So with the windows 11 looming over head and me having 5 years to try to get over to a Linux OS I&#x27;m quickly realizing why Linux just cant get a market share going cause developers literally make their proprietary software only work in windows like their intentionally creating a enforced windows monopoly.
 I cant use my k95 and icue nexus on Linux cause the icue software is windows only and corsair literally doesn&#x27;t give a shit about anything but windows.
 cant use my SoundBlaster G6 cause the software is literally windows only.
 sure there&#x27;s RGB open source software to at least customize the lighting but good luck for macro programming and touch screen programming. and good luck customizing your audio on your DAC. i swear to god I&#x27;m gonna have to buy all new hardware that&#x27;s Linux compatible from the get go once i transition to linux I&#x27;m never looking back to windows.
 but like there&#x27;s so many companies with proprietary software for their hardware that it really just feels like its just forcing people with media entertainment as their focus to stay on windows once you already purchased the hardware cause your not gonna wana just give it up cause sometimes this shit costs hundreds of dollars.
 TLDR i think i finally figured out why people hate windows so much from the linux perspective. its just hostile to new users not so much from the interface or learning how to use the os, its the proprietary software for hardware that makes it hard from someone to switch without buying new stuff unless someone was extremely nice enough to donate their time to make a reverse engineered version of it.

                <p>Hi everybody, I&#x27;m working on a command-line utility for GNU/Linux distributions based on x64, I&#x27;ve called it AppMan (Application Manager) and works like Pacman or Apt, but using only standalone applications (no shared libraries to prevent conflict with dependencies), in particular AppImages, most of them updatable.
 The installer includes three AppImages: appimageupdate (to update AppImages), pkg2appimage (to convert deb packages in AppDir folders) and appimagetool (to convert AppDir in AppImages). All the actions and the binary files are installed in /opt/bin.
 Usage
 appman [option] or appman [option] [argument]
 where option include:
 -h , help Print this message.
 -a [argument], about [argument] Show basic info on each application, link to the website and/or the source and how to update some applications.
 -c, clean Remove all unnecessary files and folders, i.e. backup files, installation scripts, and temporary folders zip or deb packages.
 -f, files Programs installed on the system.
 -i [argument], install [argument] Install a program. It can be used to update... non-updatable programs too (see -u, update).
 -l, list Shows the list of apps available in the repository.
 -r [argument], remove [argument] Removes a program (requires confirmation, default is N).
 -s, sync Updates the list of available apps.
 -u, update Update AppImages using &#x27;appimageupdate&#x27;, if the update info is embedded into the AppImage itself by the developer.
 The link to the repository is this: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan
 The list of available apps is here, I&#x27;ve also provided some templates for you to modify the way you like (here). Any pull request is welcomed.
 ​
 I hope you enjoy it.

                <p>They add nothing of value to this sub. We get it, embedded systems run on Linux. It&#x27;s not even interesting stuff being shared, but billboard after billboard. Tell me nuclear missiles run on Linux and you got my attention, otherwise it&#x27;s not surprising at all.

                <p>I&#x27;ve been using Ubutu as my daily OS for the past 8 years and am a big fan of Linux in general. Just wondering what you think could improve about it. Is there anything that bothers you on a regular basis? any examples of backward- compatibility hindering user experience?

                <p>Most distros, especially the most popular ones (with a few exceptions) choose Gnome as the default DE. Some of them have editions with different desktop environments, but they aren&#x27;t the default and are seen as alternatives. What could explain that? Gnome&#x27;s simplicity and quality? Licensing? Politics? Easier integration? Historical reasons?

                <p>I have been using Manjaro for about 2 years. The first year I was using packages from repositories and Manjaro felt unstable. I had to reboot pc regularly to “fix” things and I reinstalled Manjaro 2 times in that time. After that I started using flatpaks for everything. I even uninstalled preinstalled apps and installed flatpak versions instead. I have had zero problems since. Steam is the only thing that is not installed as flatpak, for obvious reasons.
 Does anybody else have similar experience?
 I&#x27;m kind of considering moving to Solus. The only reason I was using Manjaro was AUR, but I have only one package installed from there, and I barely use it.

                <p>I am heading to university and undoubtedly PDFs are going to be a part of life. I am wondering what your favorite PDF viewers, particularly editors, are. I&#x27;ve done some work with LibreOffice draw on this subject, but I am wondering if there is anything better

                <p>I just want to write about my road to GNU/Linux and FOSS, hope it&#x27;s allowed in this community. I&#x27;m studying electronic engineer, so I have a few years of c and c# coding and I like to tinker a lot. 
 It all started in my last year of highschool when the need to try and start knowing something about Linux showed on. The only opinion I had was my father&#x27;s, an SQL server developer married with Microsoft, telling me there&#x27;s no support at all, nothing works, etc. I first tried the &quot;mainstream&quot; ones, Pop! OS, Linux mint cinnamon, Manjaro KDE (never tried Ubuntu though). I had no knowledge at all, was software pinned (using Solidworks, Altium and others of this type because of the school) and I did install it on a notebook hdd so performance was not the best, so I quit. 
 Next year (this year, Ma…</p>

                <p>To preface, I never used Linux regularly. Back in high school and college nearly a dozen years ago, I kept a Linux install on my laptop so that I could use Aircrack-ng to get free WiFi since Aircrack-ng didn&#x27;t work on Windows. (This was when WEP was still extremely prevalent for wireless networks.) After getting the password, I would switch to Windows. I used Ubuntu back then, thought GNOME was slow and awful, and switched to XFCE instead. 
 However, as WEP went away and WPA looked like more of an effort to crack (dictionary attacks look like they took too long), I stopped using Linux and haven&#x27;t really touched it since. 
 Recently though, I decided to give Linux a spin after hearing news about the Steam Deck and how SteamOS is switching to Arch. I installed a copy of Kubuntu on my Thinkpa…</p>

 Blog post✒️: https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2021/09/07/OpenSSL3.Final/
 Here is an excerpt from the blog post:
  
After 3 years of development work, 17 alpha releases, 2 beta releases, over 7,500 commits and contributions from over 350 different authors we have finally released OpenSSL 3.0! In addition to this there has been a large number of contributions from our users who have been actively working with the pre-release versions to test it, make sure it works in the real world and with a large array of different applications and reporting their results. I am also delighted to note that there has been a 94% increase in the amount of documentation that we have since OpenSSL 1.1.1 and an (adjusted) increase in the “lines of code” in our tests of 54%. There has never been a better demonstration of what an active and enthusiastic community we have than when you look at the statistics for the OpenSSL 3.0 development work. Thanks to everyone who has taken part - no matter how small that part was.

                <p>PSA
 There is a HUGE bug in all openSUSE distributions (Leap, Tumbleweed, Factory, etc) for unzip. It seems to consist on an unpatched CVE from 2013. Unzip will randomly change a file when extracting into a symlink, breaking it.
 Since unzip is used for deployment pipelines and applications, this has the potential to affect a lot of users and workflows, and may have subtly broken a lot of things all these years!
 This same bug was fixed and patched in other distributions such as Debian since 2013.

                <p>Just curious to see what the linux community
  
Thinks about &quot;commercial&quot; linux based phones (like Pinephone)
 Knows about them? As in what&#x27;s out there?
  
Looking to move from android at some point, but looking for some pointers from the experts?

That is compared to just exploring the files via the filesystem at /etc/init.d/ using them like /etc/init.d/ntpd restart. Most systems out of the box aren&#x27;t setup with proper shell completion for systemctl and service commands. That means you have to remember complex commands to even know what your system is running to begin with. 
 How was this allowed to happen and do people consider it more user friendly?

                <p>In attempt to bring a QR code scanner application to Linux phone (PureOS, Pinephone), I updated my CoBang app with libhandy to make its UI responsive (v0.9.0).
 Desktop view
 ​
 Mobile view
 However this is just the first step. I don&#x27;t have any Linux phone so I don&#x27;t know how it looks like in real devices and what other changes to make. It would be nice if someone can help.
 For now, only Ubuntu 21.04 package is available (cannot support older Ubuntu because of Libhandy v1 dependency). Other packages for ArchLinux, Fedora may come later (those are done by ArchLinux &amp; Fedora community). It would be nice if someone help package for Flatpak (it is tiresome to me because of having to write build script for dependencies).

                <p>Disclaimer: This enables a feature that is disabled by default, if you are experiencing render issues make sure to remember how to turn in off again!
 I have an AMD GPU that uses the amdgpu driver, if you are not using MESA drivers your experience may vary!
 Some people are experiencing shorter battery life / worse performance when browsing the Web on Linux. Some if it may well be because Chrome to this day (Version 93) still disables GPU accelerated video decode by default.
 To check it for yourself, go to chrome://gpu/ - if everything there is green for you, great! You can stop reading this post.
 If you, like me, find both &quot;Video Decode&quot; and &quot;Rasterization&quot; to be &quot;Software only&quot; and want to change that, keep reading. I noticed most of the &quot;Problems Detected&quot; are more than a decade old and even stem from the fglrx driver. So just because AMD had terrible drivers in the past, Chrome still plays it safe and does not touch hardware acceleration to avoid breaking some fringe configuration!
 But MESA drivers are pretty good now, let&#x27;s get rid of that blacklist:
  
Enable the Hardware Accelerated Video Decode flag in chrome://flags/#enable-accelerated-video-decode
 Enable Vulkan rendering in chrome://flags/#enable-vulkan
 close Chrome, start it with google-chrome --use-gl&#x3D;desktop --enable-features&#x3D;VaapiVideoDecoder You can edit your launcher settings to always include those parameters
  
Now check chrome://gpu/ again. If everything went right, you should see a lot of green there now. Video decode should now use a lot less of your CPU. YouTube will typically server you VP9 or AV1 video for which only the very latest hardware has hardware support. If you rely on hardware video decode either because you are on an old machine or you want to maximize battery life, the h264ify extension would force the use of H.264 streams. However this does not appear to work anymore.

                <p>Since I can&#x27;t just use git push with a username and password for github anymore, I had to learn to use a token today. I found using the token and URL on the command line extremely inconvenient, so I piped some commands to make the URL with the token automatically. This assumes you store your token at /root/token, so I&#x27;m also curious to hear if there are any security implications handling it this way, thanks. 
 I named the script github-push and aliased it, just so the shell can find it.
 #!/bin/bash git push $(git remote -v | awk &#x27;NR&#x3D;&#x3D;2{print$2}&#x27; | sed s/github/$(sudo cat /root/token)@github/)

                <p>I recently decided to try Linux again after many on and off attempts over the last 15+ years. Every time I used Linux, there would ALWAYS be something that would go wrong, usually hardware driver related that led to endless googling, then I just gave up as I don&#x27;t have the time nor am I in that particular line of work.
 Anyway, I&#x27;m lucky I bought a Dell XPS 9370 several years ago. I installed Zorin OS and low and behold, brand new laptop (operates much cooler, and the coil whine seems to have disappeared funnily enough).
 Thankfully, everything works out the box (except the fingerprint sensor, I can&#x27;t get that to work, if anyone can point me in the right direction that would be great, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker).
 So after installing Zorin on an encrypted partition over my old windows hd (complete wipe), I have a fully functional Linux OS that pretty much works (finally after many years!!).
 I accidently stumbled upon LTT&#x27;s YouTube video in which he talks about Steam, I thought am I hearing this right?? After downloading and installing Steam, I am able to load up AAA titles on my LINUX OS!!??!!!!. I cannot believe my eyes. When did this happen? My research indicates its using a modified version of Wine (designated Proton).
 I haven&#x27;t tested it yet on my new Dell XPS 9790 (RTX 2060 MaxQ). Hopefully Zorin (Ubuntu base LTS 20.04) is compatible with this gpu, as I want to wipe W10 from my new machine and install Linux exclusively with a W10 vm.
 A big congratulations to the Linux community for achieving major milestones without any help from Microsoft.
 ​
 Edit: I&#x27;m getting downvoted by some scrotums for simply congratulating and thanking the Linux community for outputting some amazing accomplishments. Madness!

                <p>My PC is fast enough to run the newest games but unwanted Windows processes with random names slow it to a crawl for no reason. If Linux lacks these problems AND can let me continue to work on my personal indie game project using game maker I will convert in a heartbeat.

                <p>When it comes to partitioning I&#x27;m no expert. I&#x27;ve looked up a few posts on how to do this but most either mention gparted (Mint seems to come with gnome-disks instead), or they assume you&#x27;d rather just reinstall linux entirely.
 What would be the best way to backup my linux partition, remove my windows partition, then expand mint to the whole drive, with minimal reinstalling and fixing afterwards?

                <p>On linux i always try to use de eg xfce, lxde,lxqt etc and not prefer much kde ,gnome and other high ram of usage de (desktop environment).
 To my surprise the xorg that i&#x27;d been using for a long time for Desktop user actually have a security issue. 
 My question :
 1) if i still want to use Xwindows Xorg is there a way to increase it security or it is advisable to use wayland ?
 2) What is the status of Wayland for desktop user to use it as daily driver. Does it usable and stable to use it as daily driver?
 3) how to use wayland on xfce,lxqt or lxde desktop environment. Could not find a guide for it.

                <p>I am trying to update my WSL 1 to WSL 2. I have already downloaded the WSL 2 kernel update. I went into the powershell and already changed the version default to 2. However when I type &quot;WSL --list --verbose&quot;, it still only shows me WSL 1 and nothing else. I&#x27;m not sure what information would be relevant to helping solve this problem so just ask away.

                <p>A thread in a related subreddit got me remembering a time when I talked to an anti-fraud employee at a big company about how they flag suspicious activity. I was informed that using Linux to access the website for transactions was a red flag, but a minor one, and only one of many that could be raised (so that alone might not have gotten someone shut down/out, but it was seen as a negative).
 Has anyone experienced similar scrutiny, or even been outright accused of, or targeted for, their use of Linux?

                <p>My ultimate aim is to be untethered from Microsoft, Google, Amazon &amp; Apple.
 This is my plan- 
 1) Building a Linux based desktop and a NAS. 
 2) Get off Google search. (Use DuckDuckGo maybe?. Not sure)
 2) Ditch the smart phone and use an old fashioned flip phone
 3) Get off Amazon Prime.
 Any good primers on how to build a stable and robust Linux PC?

                <p>Hello everyone, I decided to share my last project here in hope it is useful and helps some of the Linux users (except me of course). This project is dedicated to the command-line lovers that has lots of documents to handle.
 The reason I started developing this program is because of the fact I&#x27;m a command-line fan, plus I also have a fairly minimal system with no file manager, I needed a program that helps to find the desired document path and to open it using my favorite application. So I decided to create this program which in the end turned out to have these 2 features that are mentioned above and a lot more. Some of the features are :
  
Counting the existing documents and files with the passed string sequence in their names
 Listing the existing documents and files with the passed string sequence in their names
 Displaying details and info on the documents with the passed string sequence in their names
 Opening the founded document or file with the passed string sequence in it&#x27;s name using your favorite application 
  
And of course a lot more, like alphabetical sorting, reversing the results and outputting a colorful results...
 I really hope that it&#x27;s useful for some of the folks out there in the Linux community :)

                <p>What sticks out to you as just being interesting and cool in that geeky sort of way? :)
 For me, installing Gentoo from scratch and seeing it evolve into a usable system was fun and rewarding. Also, creating a makeshift NAS with a spare hard drive and raspberry pi was fun to mess around with.
 Virtual machines and containers are also something that looks fun to me, after watching a few videos about them. 
 So tell me, what do you get a kick out of when it comes to Linux and computers?

                <p>I’d say cloud functions are one of the most transformative technologies in the last bunch of years. They are (usually) cheap, scale well, secure in their inherit isolation, and often written in JavaScript—comfortable territory for front-end developers. Nearly every cloud …

                <p>This issue was already addressed 6 (!!) years ago and one project member labeled it as &quot;Won&#x27;t Fix&quot; because it worked as expected on his machine... He said that we should instead try to play with our input settings. Too bad they have no effect on the scroll speed difference between Chromium and e.g. Firefox.
 This unwanted behavior has been confirmed and discussed by so many people throughout the years (see the Chromium issue, issues from Electron apps, issues from Brave browser, reviews for the many extensions trying to solve the problem).
 I have tried the Linux Scroll Speed Fix extension but it disables the smooth scrolling and has some issues (e.g. PDFs, iframes, smooth scrolling through css is laggy). Also, it obviously has no effect on Electron apps.
 I think this issue is a deal breaker considering it effects so many apps - not only the browser. It makes the Linux ecosystem less attractive, especially if you get recommended to &quot;play with the input settings&quot; (this has nothing to do with playing). So many people are asking for a simple and user-friendly solution.
 In my opinion Chromium should provide an interface to set the scroll speed (for Electron) and a user-friendly setting in the browser where you can set the scroll speed. What do you think about it and how can we draw more attention to this issue?

                <p>When i search google i only can find something like ram usage different but hard to find real data of security test on this 3 os.
 I would to see the os eg linux distro ubuntu security test result, windows 10 and Apple when apply the same security stress test on them.
 Eg of test Fresh install of ubuntu, ubuntu with latest update and enable gufw, windows fresh install and update to latest security update, apple etc.
 Hope anyone could share with me the data.

                <p>Hi guys 👋 
 Long time Linux user here that went to MacOS full time back in 2011. I have recently decided to come back to Linux full time on my machines and ditch the Apple ecosystem altogether.
 Let me just say Linux on the desktop has polished up so much since I’ve been away. It’s amazing. I practically have an alternative app or an equivalent app for all of my work flows. The only exception is firewall.
 On MacOS I lived by an app called little snitch which would let you block connections to and from your machine on a per application basis. It was great because I could allow safari access to the internet, but block things like the notes app, or Microsoft word.
 Does anyone know a good alternative for Linux ? I’ve heard of opensnitch but idk if it’s still actively developed anymore and I’ve had troubles getting it installed and working properly. My end goal is to block all internet connections except for the apps and services I chose to allow.

                <p>Stumbled across this by accident, the FISH protocol. From the entry:
  
The advantage of FISH is that all it requires on the server-side is an SSH or RSH implementation, Unix shell, and a set of standard Unix utilities (like ls, cat or dd—unlike other methods of remote access to files via a remote shell, scp for example, which requires scp on the server side).
  
So really, what&#x27;s the advantage? If I have the &quot;standard Unix utilities&quot; I most likely already have OpenSSH installed, and thus the scp and sftp parts included. If I have any other SSH implementation, there probably won&#x27;t be the standard utilities installed.
 Am I missing something here as to why this procotol is actually needed?

 Appwrite Dashboard
 I&#x27;m an Appwrite maintainer and we&#x27;re happy to share that Appwrite 0.10 has just been released and adds support for one of our most requested features.
 Appwrite now comes with platform wide Realtime API that allows you to listen to any server side event. This includes events like user registration, file uploads, document updates, serverless function executions and much more!
 Here&#x27;s a sneak peak of 0.10
  
A brand new Realtime Server
 Real time support in our Web, Flutter and Android SDKs
 New user update endpoints for admins to manage users
 Authentication with Magic URLs
 Even Faster Cloud Function executions
 We&#x27;ve terminated some bugs
 Not to mention, we&#x27;re one step closer to becoming a complete Firebase Alternative
  
If you haven&#x27;t heard already, Appwrite is an open-source end-to-end BaaS that helps you build your Web, Flutter and Android apps much faster with a focus on simplicity, developer experience, privacy and security that you can self-host with a single Docker command.
 We&#x27;d love to get your feedback as we move on to v1.0 of Appwrite in the coming weeks. Community feedback has been one of the major driving forces for where the project is today.
 You can checkout our Github repo at: https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite

                <p>Dear Linux community.
 in the last few weeks I have been developing an application that allows you to map macro keys (&quot;G-Keys&quot;) to a different key, key combination or macro, since they were basically useless on my G910 keyboard.
 It is still WiP, but I have finished the first version ready for testing. 
 So if anyone running Debian / Ubuntu (support for other distributions will come) has a Logitech G910 keyboard and is willing to give it a try and give me some feedback, feel free to do so ;).
 The project is published under GPL v3 on GitHub:

                <p>I&#x27;ve been using Arch for a while as my daily driver and only OS. Same install over the last few hardware configs, worked pretty great. The only issue is that I accumulated a lot of packages over time, doing stuff, testing etc., and starting from a clean slate seemed easier than hunting down packages I don&#x27;t use. I&#x27;m also switching jobs, and the new job will require some Ubuntu and Windows skills - I haven&#x27;t used Ubuntu for years, and in a long time I only used Windows on company laptop for Office, Teams and WSL. Yesterday&#x27;s freetype2 update breaking Steam Runtime gave me the perfect excuse to try something new.
 So I decided to set up dual boot on my desktop PC, something I haven&#x27;t done in a decade, with Pop!_OS 21.4 and Windows 11 insider preview (to get used to it, as I guess most compan…</p>

                <p>So basically on device such as an iPad or phones in general sense when two multiple tabs containing audio are opened only one chooses to play at a time where as it is not same for laptop or PC is there a specific reason why are they limited by software wise. I also have another question on how multiple tabs can play audio simultaneously on PC.

                <p>Free Desktop is the runtime underneath all flatpaks that you can get from Flathub.org It also functions as the base for the GNOME and KDE runtime so over time, improvements made in the Free Desktop Platform will reverberate through the entire Flatpak ecosystem.
 Major improvements:
  
RISC-V support
 Reintroduce gstreamer-vaapi as extension
 SDL 2.0.16 (Vastly improved Wayland support for games)
  
Other than that, it seems like a pretty standard release.
 I&#x27;ve personally been responsible for adding TeX Gyre fonts, which should improve text-compatibility. As a drop-in replacement for Helvetica (amongst others) this should improve the rendering of websites and emails who don&#x27;t properly define font-families. There is still some other work in the pipeline to improve font-compatibility (waves fist in anger at Verdana) but this should help those who sometimes notice rather basic Text rendering in for example Firefox.

                <p>Nathan Hardy shares when things “clicked”:
Reflecting back on this time, I think there are a few key concepts that were vital to things finally all making sense and fitting together. These were:
• The Box Model (e.g. box-sizing, height, width, margin, padding)
• Layout

                <p>Not to versed on Rsync but curious if this scenario is something it&#x27;s capable of...
 I have an internal hard drive I store media and backups on. I want this sync&#x27;d in real time to a samba share which Plex uses for it&#x27;s media. Effectively I&#x27;d like to just dump a ripped CD onto the local disk and for Rsync to see something changed so copy that to the samba share. Unless Linux (using Pop Os distro) has something built in capable of doing that automagically.

                <p>Look I&#x27;ve been using computers for as long as I can remember, and I&#x27;ve never felt so... Powerful using my pc before. 
 I used everything from windows XP and above (probably earlier versions too but I was too little to remember). Used macOS since Lion. And while using my computer then was pretty great now I finally found what I felt was lacking on other operating systems... I have no idea what it is, but I found it.
 It can be as simple as being able to change my desktop environment, window manager, the color of my terminal... as far as having my computer fully accessible through SSH and streaming videos to my iPad. I feel like learning how to use a terminal, and with it Linux as the backbone has given me so much more knowledge about how my computer works than Windows or macOS ever did, and…</p>

                <p>I ended up finding a Reddit post of this topic from 10 years ago, and I was kinda surprised at that time there were quite a few still in their teens (probably changed a lot since but still interesting to me). I assume most of those users still use Linux today, but how old are you guys mostly now?
 EDIT: To start, I can say that I am 17 and I just fully started using Linux on my PC

                <p>So I decided to install Endevour OS to try out Arch [I kind of like it, super snappy but prefer Debian], and well I decided to install it with Plasma, XFCE and Gnome. Well I really do not like the look of Gnome 40 at all, it just looks plain and there is nothing to it. Like I really like the look of gnome 3 and 2. So I think if Ubuntu swaps to Gnome 40 and I don&#x27;t like it I will probably revert to Unity 7 (and 10 when it comes out).

                <p>I just wanted to share that if you are upset about what&#x27;s happening on Reddit, or even just don&#x27;t like the centralized closed-source nature of the platform that you can find Linux content on Mastodon.
 This particular Mastodon instance has a character limit of 56k and is generally focused on S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math)
 https://qoto.org/tags/linux
 Here are some FOSS accounts:
 https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux
 https://fosstodon.org/@tenacity
 https://hostux.social/@fsf
 https://mastodon.cloud/@kodi
 https://mastodon.cloud/@boilingsteam
 https://floss.social/@omgubuntu
 https://floss.social/@gnome
 https://fosstodon.org/@pine64
 Edit: Also noteworthy, Mastodon has become a non-profit last month in Germany (gGmbH non-profit limited liability company)

An enabling selector is what I call a selector that does a job without disabling the particular rule.
The classic example is applying margin to everything, only to have to remove …

 Hello!
 This is ThemeChanger, an application for Linux that I wrote. I decided to present it publicly as I recently added a feature that makes this app stand out among its peers: Kvantum theme changing support. You can now change your GTK and Kvantum themes from the same app with ease. This app has also other various features, like GTK CSS editing with instantaneous preview in the app. This app works well for me, a user of a tiling WM, but the app is definitely not fully done; there are various features that I would like to add.
 This is my first kinda serious open-source undertaking, and I hope this will work out well. Feel free to share your opinions!

                <p>I found a way on xubuntu (probably other distros as well) to watch youtube without lagging (unless your system is like 20 years old).
 From my experience, the main reason youtube lags and struggles to play even 480p video on my 12 year old laptop is not the video itself but the website.
 So I found a player that also supports youtube videos to be streamed on and it actually doesnt even utilize 70% of my cpu/igpu. Its called SMPlayer and can be installed through snap! Or you can click this link: https://www.smplayer.info/
 Obviously there are other players like this but I found this working very good so im suggesting it to you..
 Im sure most of you already knew this but Im making this post just in case anyone needs it because ive seen many people ask.

                <p>When you download and install a distro, it runs on a wide range of hardware. Do you gain anything by building your own kernel specific to your computer?
 An obvious example would be Intel vs AMD. Is there extra baggage being carried around or inefficiencies because the kernel is built to run on both?
 Or is Linux (and Windows) smarter than I give them credit for?

                <p>A bonafide CSS trick if there ever was one! @ShadowShahriar created a CodePen demo that uses pseudo-elements to place commas between list items that are displayed inline, and the result is a natural-looking complete sentence with proper punctuation.

We&#x27;re at yet another reddit blackout ran by moderators, this time because of Covid Misinformation on reddit. This is obviously a big problem and the above from Linus states what r/linux moderators feel about on Covid. There is an issue to address with reddit, though, as these blackouts are not a way to work with admins. Other reddit moderators don&#x27;t seem to want to change how they enable the poor quality job the admins are doing.

                <p>I&#x27;ll be mainly doing basic stuff like web browsing, e-mails, newsgroups, downloads, listening to audio, watching videos, simple SSH2 server, etc. I currently run updated Debian Jessie v8&#x27;s KDE which is fine but it doesn&#x27;t get updates for years so it&#x27;s time to move on for a clean/new Linux installation. Will getting Bullseye v11 be OK?

                <p>Like the title says I have a Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5, and have been tinkering with Linux off of live USBs and want to get an installation on the machine. I&#x27;ve used Ubuntu on and off for the last 10 years and moved back to Windows when I got this laptop. Now that I know Ubuntu will work well on this machine I&#x27;m looking at dual booting it.
 It&#x27;s a 256GB solid state drive, and currently most of it&#x27;s internal storage is used by Windows. I&#x27;m gonna be backing it up to an external hard drive tonight I&#x27;m thinking, and am curious about a good setup for partitions.
 Would it be possible to have each operating system as its own partition, with storage that is shared between the two on a third partition? If not, what would be your recommended partition setup?

                <p>Yes, that&#x27;s PCI NOT PCIe.
 I have a vintage Pentium III system that I use for older games and software and I&#x27;m looking for suggestions for well supported graphics cards. I&#x27;ve tried running a Radeon 9200, 9250 SE and Rage 128, but those cards all use the old radeon driver and performance is far, far worse in Linux than it is in Windows. 
 I&#x27;m looking for suggestions for cards that are well supported in Linux with good 2D and 3D acceleration (for a system this old). Compatibility with Windows 9x would be a plus as well.

                <p>Hi, guys.
 I got a fake PS3 controller.
 I try to use it in bluetooth connection as wiki said, but it doesn&#x27;t work...
 I try a lot of methods on the internet, no one worked ...
 So I try to read the code of sixaxis ...
 I found that maybe the hid name of fake controller is the problem, and I make a dirty fix.
 It works for my fake controller! It could work in bluetooth mode!
 Patch is here : https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/fake-ps3.patch?h&#x3D;bluez-plugins-fix
 With this patch &quot;Authorize service&quot; will ask!
 Install it and do as wiki said, maybe will work for your fake PS3 controller.
 If you have a fake PS3 controller like me, have a try!

                <p>Looking for serious answers only. Please.
 I was a windows fan. Used it for years. A few months back, my SSD crashed. Windows on HDD was too painful for me, so I switched to ubuntu then pop. 
 ​
 Except for boot time, Linux on hdd can match windows on ssd. I am talking about app load time, switching in between, multitasking and all. 
 ​
 How? And why hasn&#x27;t windows copied it yet? 
 p.s. Package manager is a god send. Period. Just too good.

                <p>I was just thinking about this, is there anything actually stopping somebody from just flashing a linux OS/kernel directly onto a motherboards firmware besides maybe like space? Has anybody tried to do this?
 Not really much different then just running linux in an embedded environment right? Could Linux theoretically then start up a bootloader and run another Linux OS? With the bottom Linux being responsible for all the UEFI stuff and the Linux running ontop of that being responsible for all the regular OS stuff?
 Honestly it probably wouldn&#x27;t even be that bad of a thing to run on a regular desktop directly from the firmware (in a user experience kind of way), I&#x27;d guess you could still use your disk for storage and /home and stuff, just the kernel and probably the initramfs would be flashed to your UEFI.

                <p>What are some highly anticipated things coming to linux soon that you can look forward to? This doesnt have to be within 1 year, but within like 5 years aswell. The ones I know about are wayland, pipewire and more proton support, but what other systems will be big upgrades to linux world?

                <p>I may get flamed for this but I have searched for hours and it&#x27;s driving bloody insane. There was a recent post, like the last week, about a wm/or desktop that looked liked a retro/classic 90&#x27;s *nix interface but was modern. I was wanting to go back to try it but I can&#x27;t find the post anywhere now. I&#x27;ve looked here and osdev. 
 Again, sorry for the post and thanks for your patience.

                <p>Basically, this is what happens:
  
Plug flash-drive into Linux computer.
 Put files on it, eject it, and unplug.
 Plug flash-drive into Windows laptop.
 Open the drive and see the files.
 Click on a file (get errors, won&#x27;t open, blank files, etc.)
 File disappears.
  
What the hell is happening? I feel like Windows and Linux might store files differently so maybe that&#x27;s the problem, but I&#x27;m not sure. What can I do to fix this? I refuse to email large zip files or individual files back and forth forever.
 Edit: Having previously formatted on Windows, formatting to FAT32 on Linux seems to have done the trick. Thanks for everyone’s help!

                <p>With Linux turning 30 and having read the discussion between Linus and Andrew Tanenbaum, I wonder if Linux is still a monolithic kernel or has it evolved to something more along the lines of a micro kernel. I ask this as in recent years lots of stuff has moved out of the kernel and into userland. Which is one of the hallmarks of a microkernel design. Or did I misunderstand something here.

 I have worked on this for past few months . exatorrent is BitTorrent Client written in Go. It can be run locally or be hosted in Remote Server with good resources to use that Server as SeedBox. It is Single Completely Statically Linked Binary with Zero External Dependencies .
 exatorrent is simple yet feature-rich . It is lightweight and light on resources. It comes with Beautiful Responsive Web Client written in Svelte and Typescript , but thanks to documented WebSocket API of exatorrent , you can also write your own client if you want to.
 exatorrent can operate in Optional Multi-User Mode administrated by admin user/s but it can successfully be used by Single-User as well. Torrented Files are stored in local disk of device where it&#x27;s run, which are then retrievable or streamable via HTTP.
 I hope you like it . It&#x27;s Open Source .

                <p>My dumbass just did shift&#x3D;del on all files on the wrong 5TB usb drive. And after hitting myself on the head 20 times I found the tool ext4magic.
 This tool can recover all deleted files that are deleted on a ext4 filesystem. I started with photorec, but found that ext4magic seems to be much faster. I did not had the option in photorec to search only in empty space. I guess this is where ext4magic does its magic because it only lookes for files that are deleted using the filesystems journal.
 So far 114GB has been recoverd. I am sooo relieved! 😀

                <p>Every once in a while, I am installing a package through apt install and notice that a lot of the dependencies are icon themes.
 For example, recently I was installing OpenJDK and saw this:
 The following additional packages will be installed: adwaita-icon-theme fonts-dejavu-extra gtk-update-icon-cache hicolor-icon-theme humanity-icon-theme 
 Why does it need all of that, if my server doesn&#x27;t even have a display, and I only access it through SSH? What is the reason for having icon themes, fonts and other UI elements?

                <p>Modern consoles that play videos need to rely on some form of an OS. For a company such as Sony or Nintendo to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; by writing a new OS from scratch every time a new console is being developed seems to be a waste of resources. I&#x27;m not mentioning mikrosoft since they have Windows to use as a base for Xbox.
 By using something like Debian, Arch, RHEL, game companies can save time by not having to write a new OS all over again. The only issue I can see with this approach is that any modified GPL licensed code would have to be re-released under the same license and it seems that big companies are not fond of the GPL for that reason (to keep any changes to the original code private).
 Anywho, these vast array of distributions and frameworks nowadays make it silly for Sony or Nintendo to start from scratch every time they want to make a new console.
  
Note: This thread is getting so many replies. Uh, thanks. But WOW, this is interesting.

                <p>So I have been looking for replacing my current windows machine with Linux. The problem is I am very dependent on my Logitech G502 mouse in which I put a lot of macros into it. So I want to make sure that I wont get problem when i change to Linux (my current target is uBuntu, but if you have any better suggestion, I can consider too). Here is my requirement:
 - DPI control: i dont care
 - Setting up all the extra buttons BASED on active window: a must
 - RGB control: i dont care
 I have stumble upon libratbag/piper: GTK application to configure gaming devices (github.com) , that said to be an alternative, can someone give me some enlightments? thx!

                <p>Hi,
 It has been a nightmare for me to have a dedicated IP on Linux. Any service that provides an actual GUI with workign dedicated ip?
 My experience with GhostVPN was horrendous, they brag about having about having a GUI for linux. It&#x27;s basically a lame cli full of errors and nowhere on their site did they say that their dedicated IP does not on linux.
 It does not, incredible.

                <p>Evening All,
 I released a new version of rehex (a cross-platform hex editor) today - mostly bugfixes and usability improvements, I hope it is of interest to people here.
 Any questions or feedback here or on GitHub is welcome :)

                <p>Just a fun shortcut for those who might not know. This appends the final argument of the previous command to the current command and re-runs the previous command if the current command succeeded. For example
 $ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/a mount: /mnt/a: mount point does not exist $ sudo mkdir !$&amp;&amp;!! 
 the final line runs the command sudo mkdir /mnt/a &amp;&amp; sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/a. Another example
 $ cd /does/not/exist bash: cd: /does/not/exist: No ssuch file or directory $ mkdir -p !$&amp;&amp;!! $ pwd /does/not/exist 
 How does it work? Shell substitution!
  
!$: insert the final argument of the previous command
 &amp;&amp;: run another command if the previous one succeeded
 !!: insert the previous command into this command line
  
I know there are a bunch of other shell substitution stuff, but I generally find those less worth memorizing than this and just look them up when I need them.

                <p>Hi everyone,
 If you regularly check out r/linux posts, I think you&#x27;d know that I posted a post about an Artix-based GNU/Linux uses LFS/BLFS to build. I received some comments that help me improve the distribution itself.
 So I have released the next version after a month of hard work. Hope you&#x27;ll check it out here: https://hanhlinux.github.io. I&#x27;ve tested packages depend on Xorg and use it to do my daily jobs. It works really well.
 I hope that all of you can leave a comment here explain what you want me to do with the system. I really appreciate it.
 Thanks for reading! Also, happy Linux 30th anniversary.

                <p>Whenever I use software, unless it&#x27;s open source I don&#x27;t really feel &quot;safe&quot;. I&#x27;m kind of paranoid, I always belive they are snooping around my system or doing shady things, so I try to avoid proprietary software as much as possible (and apart from games, nearly all software in my system is open-source).
 For some reason tho, I don&#x27;t get that feeling with Steam. I have peace of mind with it, even tho it is prorpietary software that could potentially be snooping around my system, and I have no proof to prove or deny that, but for some reason I feel like it&#x27;s different with it.
 Does this happen to you? Why might it be? Maybe because of Valve&#x27;s attitude towards Linux? Maybe because they are not in the advertising industry?

                <p>Good day,
 a couple of years ago I posted here my tiny tool to display HDD/SSD list, with prettier output than &quot;lsscsi&quot; has. The output is similar to Solaris &quot;hd&quot; command but with a couple of extra SMART fields and colors.
 Today I&#x27;ve released shd 0.1 (requires smartmontools &gt; 7.0):
 - works much faster, no longer required to parse smartctl output, as it has finally got native JSON
 - fully rewritten in Rust, statically linked, no more Python &amp; mods required - put anywhere and enjoy
 - higher default temperature thresholds for NVMe drives
 - other small improvements

                <p>Thirty years ago I just entered college and had my first encountering with Linux four years later. Ever since then, Linux has become part of my computer journey throughout these years. My first desktop computer is a preconfigured Linux system in early 2000’s. Feel quite enjoyable with and grateful for Linux! Happy birthday Linux 1991-2021!

                <p>I am currently using MacBook Air (Intel), is it good enough to learn hardcore linux or should I get a or build a new PC for playing with linux. 
 Or just stick with EC2 instances or virtual box instances ? 
 I am not very good at using linux tho, I know the minimal stuff required for handling web development projects and handling servers in EC2.

                <p>Flathub https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.kde.haruna
 Git repo https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/haruna
 Source https://download.kde.org/stable/haruna/haruna-0.7.0.tar.xz
 This is the first release as part on KDE.
 New in 0.7.0:
  
Added custom commands. They can be used to run mpv commands, like setting properties.
 Added option to toggle the opening of last played file on start up.
 Added mouse scroll seeking when mouse is over the seek bar.
 Added action to exit the fullscreen.
 Made playback settings page more consistent with the other settings pages.
 Fixed playlist staying open when mouse moves to another screen while the app is in fullscreen mode.
 Fixed not loading audio files from same folder when opening an audio file.
  
Doesn&#x27;t look like much but the custom commands is pretty big. You can use them to control parts of mpv (set properties and run commands) not exposed by Haruna. The custom commands can be run at startup or you can trigger then with custom shortcuts, they apply when first saved.

                <p>I used to use a samsung computer with 32-bit intel pentium. I wanted to run some 64-bit applications so I decided to watch some youtube videos which said to run some random commands in cmd (I was using windows 10 at the time, I realise now how stupid that was). I borked my computer and installed a 64-bit intel pentium and then started my Linux journey. Does anybody still use 32-bit computers for Linux?
 PS - sorry for my post being so long-winded, but It wouldn&#x27;t let me post because it was too short

                <p>As the title states, next week a bunch of top tech CEOs are meeting Pres. Joe Biden 
  
 “The meeting will include Tim Cook and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, with executives from Google, Amazon, IBM, Southern Co., and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co also invited to attend.
  
 Am I wrong in that almost the entirety of the Internet runs on Linux nowadays? Sure it’s big providers like AWS, Azure, etc and a couple CDNs like Akamai but they still almost all rely on Linux.
  
 Why is there no FOSS/Linux rep? At least from the FSF or Linus himself or something. It just blows my mind.
  
 Next you will tell me there is a meeting about fast food restaurant beef quality and invite Wendy’s, White Castle, Burger King but NOT McDonald’s…. You know the biggest player.
  
 Is it because FOSS is decentralized for the most part? Still should be some kind of rep. 
 I would post a link to the article but I’m not sure if links are allowed here.

                <p>Hello,
 I&#x27;ll be working on new settings including adding automod replies for Fansly, PocketStars and Many Vids. Please comment below if there are any major ones I should add. 
 I&#x27;m also looking into expanding the MOD team because it&#x27;s a little much for me RN. 
 Thanks,

                <p>For gaming purposes (my friend group playing games that are pretty annoying on Linux), I&#x27;ve been on Windows for about the last year.
 I was wondering if any major software advances have happened in that area since then. Gaming or otherwise.
 When I last left, steam gaming was pretty good (lots of native applications), and I was happy to hear it.
 Have any other major video games that are non-Steam become native or gained support? Blizzard, Riot come to mind pretty immediately. I remember Valorant was a major concern due to the kernel-level anti-cheat the implemented.
 Pretty much the only thing keeping me from being on Linux permanently was a select few, but extremely popular video games being janky at best.
 I&#x27;m also interested in any major advancements in the normal software side of things. Adobe and such. Any big application projects in this realm for daily life or any that gained official support?

 I&#x27;ve finally finished up the last details of installing and customizing Manjaro 21.1 w/ KDE Plasma DE to my liking, and it&#x27;s just gorgeous. I&#x27;ve never seen such a beautiful, flexible desktop environment sitting on top of a distro that, so far, has met every demand I&#x27;ve had for it.
 If you&#x27;d like the same setup, the details are listed in the Neofetch screenshot above about what themes, fonts, and etc I use.
 I think it&#x27;s just gorgeous. I&#x27;m not boasting, just admiring and wanted to share.

                <p>I have been working on Ubuntu OS for about 6 years now and I am pretty happy with it. 
 Recently I wanted to revive a very old laptop so that my technically challenged mother could use it for basic web browsing or movies so I put zorin os lite because of its interface. It&#x27;s really brought back an old pentium laptop from my school days that my father was going to dump in the trash plus my mom is able to use it easily so I am very happy with that.
 I really like some of the User interface in Zorin lite so I then looked at Zorin OS 16 and it seems even better. So now I am considering whether I should jump from Ubuntu to Zorin or not. Being a software developer, the vast availability of repositories and applications available to Ubuntu compared to Zorin is the only reason I haven&#x27;t made that switch
 I was hoping to get insight from people whether they would switch from Ubuntu to Zorin and if they wouldn&#x27;t, why not? If you have some other OS you want to suggest, feel free to add those as well

 All Functions supported by the script: Main menu
 I distrohopped a lot and i found myself doing stuff over and over again so i went ahead and created scripts for the basic problems laptops user face in their installs. I use an Asus Rog so the scripts works perfectly for it. It works on other laptops too except the asusctl part.
 This script is very useful for laptop users who have to setup lots of things after installing gnu/linux. Asus users can use the asusctl option for automated install of asusctl which gives them full control over fans,rgb and graphic card switching.
 Asusctl does alot more stuff too. U can find more about it here: asusctl
 It also has an option for installing pulseeffects presets automatically which i found very tiring to do.
 Currently the script supports Pacman,Zypper,Apt and Dnf.
 ​
 I hope this helps someone .

                <p>I saw a video of a guy saying: &quot;You need to learn linux, knowing linux is extremely valuable in the IT field, if you put on your resume then you&#x27;ll be the stud in the IT field.&quot; I imagine a lot of that is just wishful thinking, but how valuable is learning linux in the IT field?

                <p>Ya know the ones where its like &quot;linux users connecting to wifi&quot; and its those h4ckErmAn scenes from movies.
 If anyone wanting to try out linux is reading this, mostly everything can be done using GUI. We use the terminal a lot cuz its more convenient.
 And for connecting to wifi you just go to settings or the top or bottom bar and click ON.

 Disclaimer: This script is made to work with my other scripts at https://github.com/sayan01/scripts and is like a part of the ecosystem. For example the accent color detection is done by &#x27;domcol&#x27; and &#x27;hexcolortoner&#x27;. The clock on the wallpaper is set by &#x27;bgclock&#x27; and the lockscreen works using &#x27;lock&#x27; which uses betterlockscreen (modified). The wallpaper is placed in .config/wall and a symlink named &#x27;wall&#x27; is created there pointing to it, which is used by bgclock. You also need the xresources patch in your dwm for the accent colors to work. If you wish to give it a try make sure to clone the entire repo and make the scripts accessible in your $PATH.
 You can also tweak the amount of difference the accent color has from the most dominant color of the image (delta)
 WM: dwm (xresources and restart patches)
 Lockscreen: Betterlockscreen
 Notification Manager: dunst
 Wallpaper Clock: bgclock

                <p>I&#x27;ve moved to linux as my daily driver and the only backlash is the complexity of settin up audio routing. I used VoiceMeeter Potato with Windows and it was so simple and just worked but haven&#x27;t found anything similar for Linux.
 Yes I know JACK has some stuff but because of how Pop!_OS is built I&#x27;m pretty much stuck with PulseAudio so it&#x27;s no use. The learning curve of using sinks and routing audio sources where i want is extremely steep and frustrating when there is no single Mixer-like GUI for handing audio that i&#x27;m aware of.
 Any GUI based app for creating PulseAudio sinks and routing them with ease? And if there isn&#x27;t an app like that - why isn&#x27;t there?

 This is how I started my GNU/Linux journey in 2003. Back then it was impossible to download a full distro because of my slow internet connection. 
 I had to buy SuSE Linux in the box with CDs and books inside (€89.90 in 2003 - not that cheap at the time). 
 Looking back, that distro feels quite primitive while it was considered among the best and user friendly! 
 A few months later (perhaps early 2004), I bought the book &quot;RH Linux &amp; Fedora Unleashed&quot; which included a DVD with the full Fedora Core (first release ever). This was far superior compared to SuSE 8.2
 I was quite a geeky kid and by my ealy teens I was able to write code in many languages, including an attempt to code in Z80 assembly on my Amstrad CPC 6128 around mid/late &#x27;80s. 
 Over the years, and with the domination of Windows, my passion for computing deteriorated. Even though I would say that &quot;I loved windows 95/98,&quot; I may have been disappointed by the lack of fascinating technologies from anyone other than Wintel.
 Linux (re)opened a whole world for me. Not least because of its free/libre nature but also about the transparency of everything. Code transparency is translated into user/developer choice from the shallowest to the deepest level of any technology - don&#x27;t forget that all developers are users too. 
 I have been using GNU/Linux (various distros) exclusively at home and in my professional setting, where the choice is exclusively mine, for the last 15 years. I have to use windows for the companies that I work for and even there, I have the choice to work on my personal computers on some projects. 
 A big, HUGE THANK YOU to all the people who have made this wonderful computing world a reality for all the geeky kids (or gen-Xer in my case) like us!

                <p>As PowerShell 7 is OS agnostic is anyone of you moved from Bash to PowerShell at Linux systems?
 I&#x27;m familiar with Windows environment and PowerShell object-oriented scripting. Learning Bash and do things on text is hard for me. 
 I&#x27;m wonder if it is common to install PowerShell at Linux machines?

                <p>Hi all, what is best source to watch for this certification?
 I love Udemy and CBT nuggets, so all suggestions are welcome. Also if someone can suggest a good book for this it will be great. I already have some but I would like to see more opinions
