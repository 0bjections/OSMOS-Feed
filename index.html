                <p>Basically, this is what happens:
  
Plug flash-drive into Linux computer.
 Put files on it, eject it, and unplug.
 Plug flash-drive into Windows laptop.
 Open the drive and see the files.
 Click on a file (get errors, won&#x27;t open, blank files, etc.)
 File disappears.
  
What the hell is happening? I feel like Windows and Linux might store files differently so maybe that&#x27;s the problem, but I&#x27;m not sure. What can I do to fix this? I refuse to email large zip files or individual files back and forth forever.
 Edit: Having previously formatted on Windows, formatting to FAT32 on Linux seems to have done the trick. Thanks for everyone’s help!

                <p>With Linux turning 30 and having read the discussion between Linus and Andrew Tanenbaum, I wonder if Linux is still a monolithic kernel or has it evolved to something more along the lines of a micro kernel. I ask this as in recent years lots of stuff has moved out of the kernel and into userland. Which is one of the hallmarks of a microkernel design. Or did I misunderstand something here.

 I have worked on this for past few months . exatorrent is BitTorrent Client written in Go. It can be run locally or be hosted in Remote Server with good resources to use that Server as SeedBox. It is Single Completely Statically Linked Binary with Zero External Dependencies .
 exatorrent is simple yet feature-rich . It is lightweight and light on resources. It comes with Beautiful Responsive Web Client written in Svelte and Typescript , but thanks to documented WebSocket API of exatorrent , you can also write your own client if you want to.
 exatorrent can operate in Optional Multi-User Mode administrated by admin user/s but it can successfully be used by Single-User as well. Torrented Files are stored in local disk of device where it&#x27;s run, which are then retrievable or streamable via HTTP.
 I hope you like it . It&#x27;s Open Source .

                <p>My dumbass just did shift&#x3D;del on all files on the wrong 5TB usb drive. And after hitting myself on the head 20 times I found the tool ext4magic.
 This tool can recover all deleted files that are deleted on a ext4 filesystem. I started with photorec, but found that ext4magic seems to be much faster. I did not had the option in photorec to search only in empty space. I guess this is where ext4magic does its magic because it only lookes for files that are deleted using the filesystems journal.
 So far 114GB has been recoverd. I am sooo relieved! 😀

                <p>Every once in a while, I am installing a package through apt install and notice that a lot of the dependencies are icon themes.
 For example, recently I was installing OpenJDK and saw this:
 The following additional packages will be installed: adwaita-icon-theme fonts-dejavu-extra gtk-update-icon-cache hicolor-icon-theme humanity-icon-theme 
 Why does it need all of that, if my server doesn&#x27;t even have a display, and I only access it through SSH? What is the reason for having icon themes, fonts and other UI elements?

                <p>Modern consoles that play videos need to rely on some form of an OS. For a company such as Sony or Nintendo to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; by writing a new OS from scratch every time a new console is being developed seems to be a waste of resources. I&#x27;m not mentioning mikrosoft since they have Windows to use as a base for Xbox.
 By using something like Debian, Arch, RHEL, game companies can save time by not having to write a new OS all over again. The only issue I can see with this approach is that any modified GPL licensed code would have to be re-released under the same license and it seems that big companies are not fond of the GPL for that reason (to keep any changes to the original code private).
 Anywho, these vast array of distributions and frameworks nowadays make it silly for Sony or Nintendo to start from scratch every time they want to make a new console.
  
Note: This thread is getting so many replies. Uh, thanks. But WOW, this is interesting.

                <p>So I have been looking for replacing my current windows machine with Linux. The problem is I am very dependent on my Logitech G502 mouse in which I put a lot of macros into it. So I want to make sure that I wont get problem when i change to Linux (my current target is uBuntu, but if you have any better suggestion, I can consider too). Here is my requirement:
 - DPI control: i dont care
 - Setting up all the extra buttons BASED on active window: a must
 - RGB control: i dont care
 I have stumble upon libratbag/piper: GTK application to configure gaming devices (github.com) , that said to be an alternative, can someone give me some enlightments? thx!

                <p>Hi,
 It has been a nightmare for me to have a dedicated IP on Linux. Any service that provides an actual GUI with workign dedicated ip?
 My experience with GhostVPN was horrendous, they brag about having about having a GUI for linux. It&#x27;s basically a lame cli full of errors and nowhere on their site did they say that their dedicated IP does not on linux.
 It does not, incredible.

                <p>Evening All,
 I released a new version of rehex (a cross-platform hex editor) today - mostly bugfixes and usability improvements, I hope it is of interest to people here.
 Any questions or feedback here or on GitHub is welcome :)

                <p>Just a fun shortcut for those who might not know. This appends the final argument of the previous command to the current command and re-runs the previous command if the current command succeeded. For example
 $ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/a mount: /mnt/a: mount point does not exist $ sudo mkdir !$&amp;&amp;!! 
 the final line runs the command sudo mkdir /mnt/a &amp;&amp; sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/a. Another example
 $ cd /does/not/exist bash: cd: /does/not/exist: No ssuch file or directory $ mkdir -p !$&amp;&amp;!! $ pwd /does/not/exist 
 How does it work? Shell substitution!
  
!$: insert the final argument of the previous command
 &amp;&amp;: run another command if the previous one succeeded
 !!: insert the previous command into this command line
  
I know there are a bunch of other shell substitution stuff, but I generally find those less worth memorizing than this and just look them up when I need them.

                <p>Hi everyone,
 If you regularly check out r/linux posts, I think you&#x27;d know that I posted a post about an Artix-based GNU/Linux uses LFS/BLFS to build. I received some comments that help me improve the distribution itself.
 So I have released the next version after a month of hard work. Hope you&#x27;ll check it out here: https://hanhlinux.github.io. I&#x27;ve tested packages depend on Xorg and use it to do my daily jobs. It works really well.
 I hope that all of you can leave a comment here explain what you want me to do with the system. I really appreciate it.
 Thanks for reading! Also, happy Linux 30th anniversary.

                <p>Whenever I use software, unless it&#x27;s open source I don&#x27;t really feel &quot;safe&quot;. I&#x27;m kind of paranoid, I always belive they are snooping around my system or doing shady things, so I try to avoid proprietary software as much as possible (and apart from games, nearly all software in my system is open-source).
 For some reason tho, I don&#x27;t get that feeling with Steam. I have peace of mind with it, even tho it is prorpietary software that could potentially be snooping around my system, and I have no proof to prove or deny that, but for some reason I feel like it&#x27;s different with it.
 Does this happen to you? Why might it be? Maybe because of Valve&#x27;s attitude towards Linux? Maybe because they are not in the advertising industry?

                <p>Good day,
 a couple of years ago I posted here my tiny tool to display HDD/SSD list, with prettier output than &quot;lsscsi&quot; has. The output is similar to Solaris &quot;hd&quot; command but with a couple of extra SMART fields and colors.
 Today I&#x27;ve released shd 0.1 (requires smartmontools &gt; 7.0):
 - works much faster, no longer required to parse smartctl output, as it has finally got native JSON
 - fully rewritten in Rust, statically linked, no more Python &amp; mods required - put anywhere and enjoy
 - higher default temperature thresholds for NVMe drives
 - other small improvements

                <p>Thirty years ago I just entered college and had my first encountering with Linux four years later. Ever since then, Linux has become part of my computer journey throughout these years. My first desktop computer is a preconfigured Linux system in early 2000’s. Feel quite enjoyable with and grateful for Linux! Happy birthday Linux 1991-2021!

                <p>I am currently using MacBook Air (Intel), is it good enough to learn hardcore linux or should I get a or build a new PC for playing with linux. 
 Or just stick with EC2 instances or virtual box instances ? 
 I am not very good at using linux tho, I know the minimal stuff required for handling web development projects and handling servers in EC2.

                <p>Flathub https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.kde.haruna
 Git repo https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/haruna
 Source https://download.kde.org/stable/haruna/haruna-0.7.0.tar.xz
 This is the first release as part on KDE.
 New in 0.7.0:
  
Added custom commands. They can be used to run mpv commands, like setting properties.
 Added option to toggle the opening of last played file on start up.
 Added mouse scroll seeking when mouse is over the seek bar.
 Added action to exit the fullscreen.
 Made playback settings page more consistent with the other settings pages.
 Fixed playlist staying open when mouse moves to another screen while the app is in fullscreen mode.
 Fixed not loading audio files from same folder when opening an audio file.
  
Doesn&#x27;t look like much but the custom commands is pretty big. You can use them to control parts of mpv (set properties and run commands) not exposed by Haruna. The custom commands can be run at startup or you can trigger then with custom shortcuts, they apply when first saved.

                <p>I used to use a samsung computer with 32-bit intel pentium. I wanted to run some 64-bit applications so I decided to watch some youtube videos which said to run some random commands in cmd (I was using windows 10 at the time, I realise now how stupid that was). I borked my computer and installed a 64-bit intel pentium and then started my Linux journey. Does anybody still use 32-bit computers for Linux?
 PS - sorry for my post being so long-winded, but It wouldn&#x27;t let me post because it was too short

                <p>As the title states, next week a bunch of top tech CEOs are meeting Pres. Joe Biden 
  
 “The meeting will include Tim Cook and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, with executives from Google, Amazon, IBM, Southern Co., and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co also invited to attend.
  
 Am I wrong in that almost the entirety of the Internet runs on Linux nowadays? Sure it’s big providers like AWS, Azure, etc and a couple CDNs like Akamai but they still almost all rely on Linux.
  
 Why is there no FOSS/Linux rep? At least from the FSF or Linus himself or something. It just blows my mind.
  
 Next you will tell me there is a meeting about fast food restaurant beef quality and invite Wendy’s, White Castle, Burger King but NOT McDonald’s…. You know the biggest player.
  
 Is it because FOSS is decentralized for the most part? Still should be some kind of rep. 
 I would post a link to the article but I’m not sure if links are allowed here.

                <p>Hello,
 I&#x27;ll be working on new settings including adding automod replies for Fansly, PocketStars and Many Vids. Please comment below if there are any major ones I should add. 
 I&#x27;m also looking into expanding the MOD team because it&#x27;s a little much for me RN. 
 Thanks,

                <p>For gaming purposes (my friend group playing games that are pretty annoying on Linux), I&#x27;ve been on Windows for about the last year.
 I was wondering if any major software advances have happened in that area since then. Gaming or otherwise.
 When I last left, steam gaming was pretty good (lots of native applications), and I was happy to hear it.
 Have any other major video games that are non-Steam become native or gained support? Blizzard, Riot come to mind pretty immediately. I remember Valorant was a major concern due to the kernel-level anti-cheat the implemented.
 Pretty much the only thing keeping me from being on Linux permanently was a select few, but extremely popular video games being janky at best.
 I&#x27;m also interested in any major advancements in the normal software side of things. Adobe and such. Any big application projects in this realm for daily life or any that gained official support?

 ​
 I&#x27;ve finally finished up the last details of installing and customizing Manjaro 21.1 w/ KDE Plasma DE to my liking, and it&#x27;s just gorgeous. I&#x27;ve never seen such a beautiful, flexible desktop environment sitting on top of a distro that, so far, has met every demand I&#x27;ve had for it.
 If you&#x27;d like the same setup, the details are listed in the Neofetch screenshot above about what themes, fonts, and etc I use.
 I think it&#x27;s just gorgeous. I&#x27;m not boasting, just admiring and wanted to share.

                <p>I have been working on Ubuntu OS for about 6 years now and I am pretty happy with it. 
 Recently I wanted to revive a very old laptop so that my technically challenged mother could use it for basic web browsing or movies so I put zorin os lite because of its interface. It&#x27;s really brought back an old pentium laptop from my school days that my father was going to dump in the trash plus my mom is able to use it easily so I am very happy with that.
 I really like some of the User interface in Zorin lite so I then looked at Zorin OS 16 and it seems even better. So now I am considering whether I should jump from Ubuntu to Zorin or not. Being a software developer, the vast availability of repositories and applications available to Ubuntu compared to Zorin is the only reason I haven&#x27;t made that switch
 I was hoping to get insight from people whether they would switch from Ubuntu to Zorin and if they wouldn&#x27;t, why not? If you have some other OS you want to suggest, feel free to add those as well

 All Functions supported by the script: Main menu
 I distrohopped a lot and i found myself doing stuff over and over again so i went ahead and created scripts for the basic problems laptops user face in their installs. I use an Asus Rog so the scripts works perfectly for it. It works on other laptops too except the asusctl part.
 This script is very useful for laptop users who have to setup lots of things after installing gnu/linux. Asus users can use the asusctl option for automated install of asusctl which gives them full control over fans,rgb and graphic card switching.
 Asusctl does alot more stuff too. U can find more about it here: asusctl
 It also has an option for installing pulseeffects presets automatically which i found very tiring to do.
 Currently the script supports Pacman,Zypper,Apt and Dnf.
 ​
 I hope this helps someone .

                <p>I saw a video of a guy saying: &quot;You need to learn linux, knowing linux is extremely valuable in the IT field, if you put on your resume then you&#x27;ll be the stud in the IT field.&quot; I imagine a lot of that is just wishful thinking, but how valuable is learning linux in the IT field?

                <p>Ya know the ones where its like &quot;linux users connecting to wifi&quot; and its those h4ckErmAn scenes from movies.
 If anyone wanting to try out linux is reading this, mostly everything can be done using GUI. We use the terminal a lot cuz its more convenient.
 And for connecting to wifi you just go to settings or the top or bottom bar and click ON.

 Disclaimer: This script is made to work with my other scripts at https://github.com/sayan01/scripts and is like a part of the ecosystem. For example the accent color detection is done by &#x27;domcol&#x27; and &#x27;hexcolortoner&#x27;. The clock on the wallpaper is set by &#x27;bgclock&#x27; and the lockscreen works using &#x27;lock&#x27; which uses betterlockscreen (modified). The wallpaper is placed in .config/wall and a symlink named &#x27;wall&#x27; is created there pointing to it, which is used by bgclock. You also need the xresources patch in your dwm for the accent colors to work. If you wish to give it a try make sure to clone the entire repo and make the scripts accessible in your $PATH.
 You can also tweak the amount of difference the accent color has from the most dominant color of the image (delta)
 WM: dwm (xresources and restart patches)
 Lockscreen: Betterlockscreen
 Notification Manager: dunst
 Wallpaper Clock: bgclock

                <p>I&#x27;ve moved to linux as my daily driver and the only backlash is the complexity of settin up audio routing. I used VoiceMeeter Potato with Windows and it was so simple and just worked but haven&#x27;t found anything similar for Linux.
 Yes I know JACK has some stuff but because of how Pop!_OS is built I&#x27;m pretty much stuck with PulseAudio so it&#x27;s no use. The learning curve of using sinks and routing audio sources where i want is extremely steep and frustrating when there is no single Mixer-like GUI for handing audio that i&#x27;m aware of.
 Any GUI based app for creating PulseAudio sinks and routing them with ease? And if there isn&#x27;t an app like that - why isn&#x27;t there?

 This is how I started my GNU/Linux journey in 2003. Back then it was impossible to download a full distro because of my slow internet connection. 
 I had to buy SuSE Linux in the box with CDs and books inside (€89.90 in 2003 - not that cheap at the time). 
 Looking back, that distro feels quite primitive while it was considered among the best and user friendly! 
 A few months later (perhaps early 2004), I bought the book &quot;RH Linux &amp; Fedora Unleashed&quot; which included a DVD with the full Fedora Core (first release ever). This was far superior compared to SuSE 8.2
 I was quite a geeky kid and by my ealy teens I was able to write code in many languages, including an attempt to code in Z80 assembly on my Amstrad CPC 6128 around mid/late &#x27;80s. 
 Over the years, and with the domination of Windows, my passion for computing deteriorated. Even though I would say that &quot;I loved windows 95/98,&quot; I may have been disappointed by the lack of fascinating technologies from anyone other than Wintel.
 Linux (re)opened a whole world for me. Not least because of its free/libre nature but also about the transparency of everything. Code transparency is translated into user/developer choice from the shallowest to the deepest level of any technology - don&#x27;t forget that all developers are users too. 
 I have been using GNU/Linux (various distros) exclusively at home and in my professional setting, where the choice is exclusively mine, for the last 15 years. I have to use windows for the companies that I work for and even there, I have the choice to work on my personal computers on some projects. 
 A big, HUGE THANK YOU to all the people who have made this wonderful computing world a reality for all the geeky kids (or gen-Xer in my case) like us!

                <p>As PowerShell 7 is OS agnostic is anyone of you moved from Bash to PowerShell at Linux systems?
 I&#x27;m familiar with Windows environment and PowerShell object-oriented scripting. Learning Bash and do things on text is hard for me. 
 I&#x27;m wonder if it is common to install PowerShell at Linux machines?

                <p>Hi all, what is best source to watch for this certification?
 I love Udemy and CBT nuggets, so all suggestions are welcome. Also if someone can suggest a good book for this it will be great. I already have some but I would like to see more opinions

                <p>Hey everyone, i wanted to preface this post by saying that i&#x27;m not making this post to hate on Linux, i loved the OS, i was actually quite disappointed that i had to switch back to Windows, i just wanted to share my experience, and i&#x27;m waiting eagerly for the day when i&#x27;ll be able to switch to Linux as my main OS.
 Context :
 I switched to Linux in February of this year after my Windows PC got infected by some ransomware and ultimately started getting fed-up for the lack of privacy and care microsoft has for you in Win10
 I mostly used Pop!_Os and used Manjaro for a week or so.
 Yesterday i decided to switch back to Windows
 What i liked about Linux :
 Amazing installers : For both of the Distros i installed, the Installers were amazing, all of them give you so much control and make it so …</p>

                <p>I have been using Linux for the last 5 years as my daily driver on my desktop machine.
 I am so exhausted with all the bugs and issues that never ever go away. It seems like I am always trying to fix or resolve something on Linux just to get basic functionality.
 I used Linux Mint for 4 years, but after an annoying bug where my window snapping would have an off by 1 error, I moved to Kubuntu Plasma.
 Both of these distros would not reliably wake the monitor. Suspending, logging out, switching users, waking from suspend/monitor off have been nothing but issues for me....the entire time I have been on linux.
 At first I used an Nvidia card, and everyone at KDE was like &quot;Use AMD, its so much better&quot;....so I tried AMD. I am running an RX580 video card, which is as mainstream AMD as you could get....still tonnes of issues. It freezes when I switch users periodically. I just tried to wake my computer and the monitor was black......and I have suspend and power off monitor disabled (wtf?).
 It seems like for every bug that is fixed in KDE Plasma, a new one is created, and I really don&#x27;t look forward or have hope for any new version.
 I honestly have come to the conclusion that it is just not worth it. My hobby is not my OS, and as someone who just wants to live a stress free life and get things done, I just don&#x27;t think Linux is for me. I am quite disappointed.

                <p>I have been an avid linux user since I was 6 years old and my father stole my xp key on the old gateway pc I was allowed to use without internet. Over the years I became an enthusiast, learning and using Linux wherever I could and sharing how useful it can be with friends. Today I got an interview with an MSP who just got a new client that is purely based on Ubuntu and since my Linux experience is fairly extensive they gave me an offer on the spot! So exciting.

                <p>I just got an HP Envy x360 15z-ee100. I wiped Windows and installed Manjaro on it but the screen rotation doesn&#x27;t work and there&#x27;s no on-screen keyboard, fingerprint sensor also doesn&#x27;t work but I&#x27;m not concerned with it. WiFi didn&#x27;t work at first. I had to USB tether from my phone to get the internet and then install rtw89 driver to get it working. 
 Also the stylus doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as it did on Windows. I know most of these stuff aren&#x27;t deal breakers but it pains me to see such poor support for convertibles.

                <p>The linux community back then was much smaller and there were much less coders to contribute not to mention not many cared about the idea of FOSS. In addition internet speed was slow so downloading software, and uploading source code and contributing must have been a lot more difficult than now days. I clearly remember testing it out that printers and WIFI was a major issue and many things were missing drivers.
 To the hardcore ones, do you think linux back then was as viable replacement for Windows/Mac as is today or things have advanced so much to the better now?
 Thanks for holding ground for the rest of us who went Windows/Mac :D

                <p>I see many people praising GTK apps&#x27; looks and thight integration with many DEs. It then seems logical to want to learn to use it. The problem is, the official docs are great... For C, and other languages&#x27; bindings are not as good and sometimes outdated.
 So this is my question, how does one learn to use GTK ? Looking at source code is great, but isn&#x27;t there another way ?

                <p>I’ve seen this confuse more than a handful of people recently, including myself, so I’m making sure it’s written down.
Let’s chuck a couple of custom properties into CSS:
html {
  --color-1: red;
  --color-2: blue;
}
Let’s use them right …

                <p>There’s still no support for too many important web components even integral stuff. Even nginx doesn’t officially support it yet? 
 What are the alternatives. I know there’s alma but that seems to be even worse if your using certain cloud providers.
 Is there any other decent rhel fork at this point?l that is truly production ready?

                <p>I recently switched to an Arch-based distro and honestly it&#x27;s the best UX I&#x27;ve come across of all distros I&#x27;ve used before. 
  
The AUR is the best thing since sliced bread. With an AUR package manger (e.g. I use yay) you can install almost any popular app out there with a single command. Installing stuff like Joplin, Intellij IDE&#x27;s, Spotify, discord, filezilla, and tonnes of others is such a pleasure compared to the install procedures on other distros. If you&#x27;re lucky you get a .deb you can install on a Debian-based distro, but usually you have to extract tarballs and set up .desktop files yourself, which is such a hassle. Not to mention manually managing updates.
 The Arch wiki is my savior. Pretty much every issue I&#x27;ve come across since installing has had a dedicated Arch wiki page with well-written instructions on how to fix the problem. I haven&#x27;t seen similar user-friendly and in-depth wikis for other distros. 
  
Sure things get a little hacky at times, especially if you&#x27;re installing from the command line. But for Linux beginners an Arch-derivative with a GUI installer serves up a dream situation.

 All Functions supported by the script: Main menu
 I distrohopped a lot and i found myself doing stuff over and over again so i went ahead and created scripts for the basic problems laptops user face in their installs. I use an Asus Rog so the scripts works perfectly for it. It works on other laptops too except the asusctl part.
 This script is very useful for laptop users who have to setup lots of things after installing gnu/linux. Asus users can use the asusctl option for automated install of asusctl which gives them full control over fans,rgb and graphic card switching. 
 Asusctl does alot more stuff too. U can find more about it here: asusctl
 It also has an option for installing pulseeffects presets automatically which i found very tiring to do.
 Currently the script supports Pacman,Zypper,Apt and Dnf.
 ​
 Please contact me if you find any issue or have any suggestions for me.
 ​
 I hope this helps someone .

                <p>Hello!!
 I just started my linux journey recently, when I booted GalliumOS onto my asus chromebook. I&#x27;ve been learning how to navigate things using the terminal with commands like cd, ls, and pwd. And creating/ deleting things using touch, mkdir, and rm. Even though it&#x27;s pretty simple so far it has me feeling really good about linux and I&#x27;m excited at all the possibilities of what I can learn next. If you guys have any recommendations on what I could try next or any tips that would be greatly appreciated. If not, I appreciate you getting this far, I am super excited to join this community!

 Look like I am the only schmuck noticing this and the whole world going merry-go-around...whoever using it #linux on desktop/laptop ....irks ..
 Damnit! on Linux Desktop/Laptop , it is pretty evident that two things constantly malfunctioning. 
 One, gpg-agent died after certain time, so to bring it back , kill it .Meh .. 
 Second, Notification-daemon stops working after a certain point in time. Same treatment...kill the damn thing.

                <p>Nowadays, is possible to build a PC that use only open-source device drivers from kernel (even without closed firmwares)?

                <p>Hey All:
 I do a lot of distro hopping, and every time I reinstall a new distribution I have to reinstall and re-setup x11vnc so I can use my phone to control my computer when I am away. I got tired to doing it manual every time so I wrote this quick little script that automates the process for me. Thought I would just share it here in case anyone else is in the same boat.
 This script thus far has only been tested on Linux Mint running Cinnamon, but I would imagine it would work on any Ubuntu based distribution. I did test trying to run x11vnc on OpenSUSE, but I could never get it to work properly.
 Feel free to edit, update, or even make your own script off this. There are probably already a thousand different scripts like this in existence, but was it one of the characters in Startcraft II that said &quot;This is my C-14 Impaler gauss rifle! There are many like it, but this one is mine!&quot;
 https://github.com/BeholdenCypress/BashScripts/blob/main/x11vnc_install.sh
 P.S. Was not sure which flair to use, so sorry if it is the wrong one. Let me know which one I should&#x27;ve used and I will change it.

                <p>It started about a year ago when I was porting a REST service to C++ for fun. I was comparing different frameworks and by far the easiest to set up and get going was Crow. Problem is it was abandoned since 2017. 
 A year and a ton of hard work from myself and many other people, and not only did we fix so many problems that it had, but added many more features. The latest being blueprints similar to python flask, and a better JSON implementation (although it&#x27;s still far from perfect).
 I tried to make the whole platform more user friendly by adding in code documentation, guides, and a landing page to advertise the framework.
 I also did some simple benchmarks (mostly based on criteria set by TechEmpowered) and the results (I had to extrapolate them because I was running the tests locally on my personal machine) showed great potential, to the level where Crow would saturate a 10gbps connection at 70% performance.
 I&#x27;m making this post to let people know that if they&#x27;re looking to run their own web service or upgrade an existing one that Crow might be a viable framework for them. I apologize if this isn&#x27;t the right place or I misunderstood the rules in any way.

                <p>This version adding REALLY interesting new feature - it is now possible process multiple files in various formats and merge/mesh them into single output file formated by template. Take a look on example here https://mmalcek.github.io/bafi/examples/#multiple-input-files
 So you can combine data from various sources and generate single output view :)

                <p>I&#x27;m seeing a sad pattern lately. Software for Linux is being distributed for Linux as containers such as flatpaks, appimages, etc. or as straight binaries but the documentation that come with these formats in very limited or non-existent. I&#x27;ve also not seen any applications distributed this way contain man pages.
 That&#x27;s not to say that I&#x27;m against containerized applications. I&#x27;m, not. I&#x27;m a great proponent of appimages in particular. I think that could be a great way to bring back awesome software that is no longer compatible with current Linux distros because the dependencies have been dropped. However, I find that it&#x27;s assumed that documentation will be on a website somewhere instead of on the system with the software. I think there could/should be a middle ground where you have your containerized or binary-only packages but also full documentation with it in the form of man pages or some other easy to use format.

                <p>Weylus is incredible. It allows you to have your PC in your iPad, and you can do basically everything.
 The applications are infinite. Here&#x27;s the github page: https://github.com/H-M-H/Weylus

                <p>When I wanted to install Manjaro, I could not go into my BIOS firmware. I thought my grub was overriding my firmware so I decided to delete my /boot/grub/grub.cfg configuration and update my grub conf. I thought I could go to my BIOS settings now, but I ended up locking up my computer. I could not boot into my OS nor could I go to my BIOS settings. I later found out my motherboard was not working, thus I messed up my install

                <p>I everyone, I just wanted to share my experiences and thoughts about starting a company using only Linux and as much free / open source software as possible. I know that most other companies that do use Linux extensively tend to be technology centered companies, so I wanted to do a write up on my experience in creating a company that is not directly IT or development related. 
 First, a little background about myself. I was a software engineer for 5 years where I got most of my experience in using Linux. I then went to dental school and have been a practicing dentist ever since. This “report” will be more focusing on my dental practice and how I started it up.

                <p>You&#x27;d think a Public Domain system that all citizens can participate in building and improving, and which can simultaneously be used as a learning opportunity to increase digitalization and IT literacy, would be a slam-dunk, from the point of view of the State. Why buy an OS from some foreign megacorp, and be at the whim of their profit-motivated choices, when you can tailor your own system to your own needs, have full localization of language, standards, norms... and invite the citizens to participate themselves in giving feedback, cotributing to it, building it up, etc. They can organize armies, collect taxes, run ports, enforce laws, etc, on their own. Some of them have National Churches, National Healthcare Systems, National Education Systems. Truly enormous and outstanding organizations. I can&#x27;t imagine why they wouldn&#x27;t make and run their own publicly-supported, free-at-the-point-of-purchase, open-source OS? 
 Hell, France had even come up with their own &quot;internet&quot; standard at one point, the Minitel. Where&#x27;d that kind of effort go?

                <p>Hi, i&#x27;m so confused right now, i was doing research for days, but i couldn&#x27;t find a single reference that explains how the core implementation of widget toolkits and how they draw and make widgets like buttons, scrolling, ...?
 Is every widget is an X window that gets manipulated? if true how an X window will be rounded corners and shadow behind the window? or it&#x27;s just a bunch of graphics?
 how does scrolling is implemented for widget toolkits, i feel that scrolling is hard to be implemented in a 2D graphics API, i think that openGL will deal with this problem? but how openGL gets into the context like this?
 Thanks a lot for reading, if there are any existing resources that i am not aware of, i would really like to read.

                <p>Just found out many distro not enable the firewall on fresh installation.
 Try enable the ufw or gufw for added security on your linux box.
 Other simple added security we can enable are the &quot;full disk encryption&quot; or partially /home folder encryption.
 Most distro come with firewall preinstall but not enable by default.

                <p>Just curious about this. I have 
  
my main desktop with Kubuntu
 
super old netbook (like 2006) with LXLE, but its still kinda heavy, so I may look for even lighter option (suggestions are welcome!)
 
basic Dell laptop, with Linux Mint
 
both digitalocean droplets that run ubuntu

                <p>My country will be switching from DVB-T to DVB-T2 over the course of next year.Since my television (a 2016 Sony Bravia, not smart nor HEVC compatible) will not support DVB-T2, I have been looking for a decoder which either ran Linux or could possibly be hacked to support e.g. Debian.
 Since I see that many decoders also enable extending the TV internet connection capabilities, turning it into a smart TV, I would really be glad to run something which is not Android, so as not to worry about all the possible google and manufacturers&#x27; spyware - while at the same time reaping the benefits of a smart TV.

                <p>I really had no idea where else to post this, would appreciate it if I could be guided to a more appropriate sub for asking this question, in case this is inappropriate.
 I understand the hardware implementations of HEVC, as I am guessing it&#x27;s pretty clear that if a chip on a device were to include hardware codecs, it would be pretty easy to keep a count of them (since they would be produced in bulk). But how exactly do you get a royalty for software implementations? Technically, given the resources should I not be able to create a software implementation at home?
 According to the wiki, software implementations no longer need to pay the royalty as of 2017, but prior to that how exactly was this even enforced? 
 Is it even possible for someone to implement at least a basic variant of standard codecs at home?

                <p>I used to LOVE Windows but lately I almost only ever use Mint Linux and when I DO boot into Windows 10 I always get issues with enough Windows updates issues and conflicts to the point where I just want to delete that partition and use a Virtual Machine whenever I actually really need Windows.
 I have a 4th gen i5 processor, GTX970 graphics card, 16gb RAM, 500gb SSD, 1TB HDD, and I feel it&#x27;s a decently powerful system. I use Windows mostly for when I feel like producing music using Reaper (which I hear can run in WINE, not sure about plugin support), or playing the odd video game here and there.
 **Main question:**
 What are the drawbacks of these methods? In my mind, I assume I can keep my Linux processes running using the onboard GPU provided by the processor chip while giving my Windows VM access to my NVIDIA card so I can run... video games, photoshop, and other Windows software
 Is it a hassle to set up and maintain? I don&#x27;t mind fiddling with settings a bit, as long as it isn&#x27;t ungodly hard to make compatible. I wonder if I would have a lot of issues with my PC crashing or the VM not being able to access my graphics card consistently.
 Any thoughts/comments are welcome :D I&#x27;ve only done light research, but it sounds like a good idea

                <p>Hi all, I&#x27;m taking a class on Linux/Unix and also Python and the laptop I currently own is an ASUS i3 with 8GB of RAM and am being told it won&#x27;t do it. So, in that case, with a budget of $450 out the door, any recommendations? I can give my old laptop to the Mrs since hers is so slow and frustrating for her.

                <p>Hi everyone,
 I just brought a photon zero resin printer (which, i think, only accept .photon files) and the slicer software made by Anycubic is only compatible with windows and mac. Do any of you know an alternative that would work on linux ?
 I already tried Chitubox but it didn&#x27;t really work (also, if possible, i would prefer an open source software).

                <p>I understand that you can learn a lot by installing everything form the ground up, but isn&#x27;t ist a bit to much to ask from somebody who has no idea about linux?
 And... i really dont understand why so few recommend debian. I think it&#x27;s a good start, especially with the gui install and a simple desktop. it also leaves them with a fairly clean install so they can then build up from there.
 What do you recommend new users?

                <p>I posted this on r/linuxquestions too, but this post isn&#x27;t about using GNU/Linux but the world around it so here I go:
  
 Let me preface by saying this is not a satirical post. I am genuinely curious.
  
 Currently I am about 50% ready to make my big leap to GNU/Linux as my main OS (still planning stuff). The question in the title popped up in my head today though from my paranoia side. Who actually funds the development GNU/Linux, FOSS, etc. I am NOT insinuating anything with my question about individual developers or projects intentions. Just genuinely curious.
  
 From doing various searches you can find the Linux foundation with members requiring to pay big fees to be higher tier members and such. With other smaller projects (like Pi-hole) it&#x27;s Patreons that support it along with indi…</p>

                <p>Hello there.Does anyone know (as convenient as it gets would be great, i&#x27;m pretty much a noob on beginner user level) a solution to play audio through two sets of speaker, each on some usb/bluetooth amp? Aka &quot;an alternative to Voicemeeter Banana&quot;? With a GUI please!
 When having my pc in this room, i just plug one amp via usb, the other via bluetooth and can set both with a latency (in ms) in Voicemeeter, and give it out via &quot;voicemeter input&quot;, a virtual audio device i select in audio properties. Now both amps play.
 Can i do that in linux? I have this setup in my sleeping room (just 2 pair of speakers, each on a little 10€-bluetoothamp from eby) and can use it with my pc. but when i carry it in my living room to work next week, i just stay with my raspi as a little media calculator on my tv. Which is great, but sadly i just can run one pair of speakers at the time. Which is sure fine but both together just sound neat and round, just sweet.

                <p>I just founded on Internet and think it cool to share it.
  
Link: http://oldlinux.org/
  
OldLinux is the website created by Jiong Zhao - Chinese Engineer Staff. It collected all the material of all Ancient Linux including doc, bin, source code, some Chinese PDF File about Linux, image and more.
 You can find the early stage of some Linux major distros like Slackware, Debian, etc... You can even find the early stage of system library like gcc and a lot. Also it have the VMWare image (I)don&#x27;t know why it not have the free alternative VM image)
 If you like to view the history of Linux you can view this page.

                <p>Has anyone installed an ARM Linux on any of the ARM laptops (Surface Pro X, HP Elite Folio, Macbook Air, etc)?
 I have worked with Ubuntu ARM on Jetson boards but I believe we are moving away from X86 and in the next 5 years most of the laptops in the market will be using ARM cpus and as someone who is using only Linux for both my work and personal laptops, I want to know how easy it is to install Linux on them.

                <p>I&#x27;ve been looking for reference books about Linux to learn in a better way about the operating system (I prefer books over tutorials, YouTube videos or blogs in most cases). Some folks told me about O&#x27;Reilly and for dummies series books and I found an editorial called Packt publishing with some good titles, but I would like to know if you, redditors, have some of these books and which titles do you recommend. Thanks for your answers!

                <p>Why does one distro hop? What does one distro offer that another doesn’t? Aside from a package manager… essentially not much. So what drives one to install and reinstall over and over? I think it may be a combination of boredom coupled with a short lived sense of accomplishment. Lately when I get the itch to hop I just channel that feeling into learning C. The instant gratification isn’t there but at the end of the day once the feeling has passed, I get a better sense of peace. Any thoughts?

                <p>For me, I have been using Linux on and off for years, but the straw that finally broke the camels back this year was learning that my computer would not be able to run Windows 11. Sure, my laptop is 8 going on 9 years old now, but she is still a powerhouse.
 I finally decided that Microsoft was not going to get to decide when my laptop has had enough and needs to be replaced. With Linux installed, I will probably keep this laptop going another 5 or more years depending on the performance 5 years from now.
 How about you? What made you decide to move away from Windows, or MacOS, or whatever you used before Linux (if you used anything before Linux)

                <p>Hello, I&#x27;ve been working on trying to better understand Linux at a lower level.
 My current exercise is migrating some of my Windows services to Linux and I&#x27;m trying to do so in a best practices manner.
 ​
 I have some confusion about the partitioning recommendations in the CIS Benchmark CIS_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_8_Benchmark_v1_0_01
 ​
 Creating a seperate filesystem/logical volume for the following directories has a classification of 2 (For use in environments where security is paramount, and may have some side effects), however setting flags on those directories such as the nodev option is classified with a 1 (baseline security requirement for all environments that should have little to no impact). However I assume that setting the nodev, noexec, etc options on a folder would require that it&#x27;s a seperate filesystem or logical volume so it makes separating those a requirement?
 ​
 If I go that route I end up with 10 separate volumes with seems somewhat excessive.
 ​
 /boot
 /boot/efi
 /
 /home
 /tmp
 /var
 /var/log
 /var/log/audit
 /var/tmp
 SWAP
 ​
 How practical would having that many seperate volumes be in a production non federal information system environment? I could see it causing some support headaches for JR sysadmins?
 ​
 A specific example would be the following CIS Control
 1.1.7 Ensure separate partition exists for /var/tmp (Scored) - CAT 2 (for high security)
 1.1.8 Ensure nodev option set on /var/tmp partition (Scored) - CAT 1 (Baseline reccomendation)
 ​
 Thank you in advance!

                <p>I&#x27;ve been on mint for a few years now. I really have no problems with it. It just has a few of the little quirks about it that bug me...some of them are the same reasons I left windows (biggest among them are the forced updates.).
 So, since I&#x27;m thinking about building a new machine, I thought I would also upgrade my version of Linux.
 I&#x27;m not looking for something super locked down and difficult to use. I&#x27;d like some user friendliness, but maybe a little more control than what Mint offers.

                <p>I&#x27;ve been using Firefox for over a decade now, and although I do agree with some posts here about issues with the new UI. I believe we are going about it the wrong way.
  
 Let me preface by comparing to another recent example that I have encountered. With Apple and their new CSAM scanning aka backdoor no matter how much we kick or scream they won&#x27;t back down because they are a gigantic corporation that is also beholden to the government. In Firefoxs case, yes they are a business, a not for profit one at that. However, whatever Mozilla does to Firefox can be worked around by some tinkering or getting an alt. For example I use IceCat now because I don&#x27;t like the telemetry and some bloat in FF like Sync and Pocket.
  
 HOWEVER, if Firefox would actually stop development like so many people a…</p>

                <p>I&#x27;ve been using Ubuntu on the system I&#x27;m working on, the main reason being that I want to have an OS that remains stable for the time I&#x27;m using it for it&#x27;s purpose, long term support, no shenanigans.
 I&#x27;m interested in other systems such as Arch but I need a reliable workstation - am I wrong in assuming that a rolling release cycle might infere with that goal? Are my worries justified?
 I mostly do scientific programming, on a cluster, but locally I&#x27;d need LaTeX up and running, some stuff like Inkscape, Sublime text, maybe run some simple code here and there.
 Edit: what I mean by instability can pretty much be summed up with &quot;software components won&#x27;t work anymore after upgrading&quot;

                <p>I need to get some desktop systems up and running whose main purpose are to run a bunch of virtual machines, so I need all the spare ram I can get. I&#x27;ve been unhappy with the ram usage of Mate and XFCE, and they offer a bunch of stuff we don&#x27;t necessarily need anyway, so I&#x27;ve been looking for a window manager that&#x27;s lighter.
 However I&#x27;ve encountered a major problem. It seems that like 95% of these projects are dead and haven&#x27;t seen any updates in 5-15 years, and the other 5% that are alive act like they tripped and fell out of 1998. They don&#x27;t support HiDPI monitors, they don&#x27;t support asian/middle eastern languages or emoji, they have no ability to graphically configure any options or preferences, half of them don&#x27;t even come with a taskbar, etc. (And that&#x27;s not even touching on how they look ugly as sin).
 Is there any option out there that was designed this millennia? Something that can be used on modern hardware by normal office workers in an international setting?
 edit: Also I forgot to mention that this needs to be a floating/stacking window manager, ones that are tiling-only won&#x27;t work for our use case.

                <p>I have created a 40TB volume and the used space is 286G. There is no data on the disk and no hidden files. I have researched and found that this is the metadata (data about the future data) on the volume. Is this size able to be changed? Does XFS recommend this size? What are the options on this size if any?

                <p>A friend asked me to save their old laptop so their kid could use it. But they&#x27;re really fed up with mobile app games and such, they want a platform that supports edultainment, looks attractive, and gives them plenty of parental control.
 The laptop is a relatively old HP pavilion. It overheats on Windows 10. It performs very well with AntiX with LXQt, but then the Sugar packages don&#x27;t seem to work.
 The country&#x27;s language is Spanish.

                <p>You can try vaapi acceleration on latest Firefox too on linux.
 On Firefox stable go to about:config and set :
 gfx.x11-egl.force-enabled to true media.ffmpeg.vaapi-drm-display.enabled to true media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled to true
 media.ffvpx.enabled to false
 Then install firefox add &quot;h264ify&quot; for youtube. Then play some video and watch the cpu usage got drop or still high.
 And add addon &quot;h264ify-embed-fix&quot; for hardware acceleration other than youtube website eg vimeo.
 Firefox getting better and better with their latest release. Cant wait for &quot;WebGpu&quot; to be implement on firefox stable.
 Anyway once everything work you can remove h264yify addon. After that monitor again the cpu usage when playing youtube video whether it drop or increase with h264yify disable.
 Tested on Firefox 90.0

                <p>Hi, I&#x27;m a comp engineering student and we got an assignment to write about something OS related. 
 I thought I would write about how processes and threads work in linux by giving an overview of the underlying datastructures and algorithms.
 Someone know/have any tips about where I can find info on this?

                <p>I was on search for some good fonts for terminal and vim, after a lot of search I found Inconsolata from nerd font website, I just fell in love with the font and had to download it. Sadly it did not have ligatures.
 TLDR
 I patched InconsolataGo with both nerd-font and all the ligatures!! here is the link

                <p>Alright, lets face it. Linux does not have 100% feature parity to Windows when it comes to applications. There are just some applications for Windows that A) do not have a Linux counterpart or B) has a Linux counterpart, but is sorely lacking.
 So I just wanted to start this discussion. What are some of the Windows applications you use in Linux using Wine? For me the two biggest ones are 7-Zip and Foxit Reader. I use 7Zip on Windows, and the archive manager in Linux just does not compare. Same with Foxit. The Linux version of Foxit just does not hold a candle to the Windows version.
 The best part I think it, both these applications work flawlessly using Wine.

                <p>I see more and more distros no longer support 32-bit architectures. The same applies to software. I&#x27;ve been trying to apply AntiX and Tinycore Linux to some old machines. Even installing GRUB was a challenge and took several tries. (Windows XP looks so much uglier than I remember.) 
 There seems to be a lot of older machines that would be given a second life by lightweight Linux distros. But how can we keep them relevant and functional in a world where ten packages in a given dependency tree get updated every other day?

Don&#x27;t do this unless you can afford break your installation. I had a minimal amount of packages and user no data, but that might not be the case for you.
 I recommend logging out of the graphical session and using a tty instead (Ctrl+Alt+3). The GUI is going to be broken in all sorts of fashions before all problems are resolved. And you&#x27;ll probably be ejected from your session mid-update, so don&#x27;t even bother.
  
Change /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d entries from bionic to focal.
  
Open each URL you&#x27;re about to change in a browser to verify that the dist folder has a focal folder. If it doesn&#x27;t, then don&#x27;t change it to focal, let it bionic.

                <p>VA-API
 Va-api installation depending on the GPU generation you have, so I recommend you to follow this excellent Arch linux guide, (It&#x27;s not just for arch linux, applies to ubuntu as well)
 https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hardware_video_acceleration
 Once you download the package, verify it using vainfo or vdpauinfo depending upon your GPU. Then you are good to go.
 Browser
 You can use any chromium based browser like Brave and Vivaldi, but for this guide I will be using chrome-stable. I will be also using x11 for this guide, so few steps might vary for wayland.
 Version
 Unfortunately chrome 92 update broke hardware acceleration on linux, so we will be using Chrome 91. Google might &quot;fix&quot; it in future, but no can guarantee it.

                <p>Over the past few years, I&#x27;ve been using Windows 10 and while I do enjoy using it, lately I&#x27;ve been feeling that there is something about it which makes it seem as if it does not have any personality of its own ? Everything felt very superficial, inconsistent. It felt almost as if someone else was in control of my computer, automatically managing my updates, preferences, and apps that I install onto my system. 
 Over the years of using Windows 10, I grew accustomed of these inconveniences. 
 1.) There were instances where Windows would update automatically and install a load of bloatware (stupid games from their Windows store) onto my PC without my permission.
 2.) After almost every major update, my preferences would automatically reset or change to something else entirely. 
 3.) I grew a…</p>

                <p>When on here, I see a lot of people saying that they hate Ubuntu. Canonical is a little flawed as a for profit company but that can be nullified by installing a Ubuntu spin that isn&#x27;t controlled by Cannnical. While the amazon thing was bad, that was years ago and they have fixed it. I would like to hear yall&#x27;d take on it.

                <p>There are a lot of people who get into Linux and get over their head quickly and go back to Windows or Mac. Even more seasoned people struggle with certain things.
 ​
 What if there was a feature built right into most Linux distros (or at least the main ones with companies behind them) where you could turn it on, write out your problem then you connect to a support technician and if they believe they can solve the issue, they could either charge a fee, or maybe there could be a monthly fee for some people who want it, and they can ask as much as they want for that flat fee.
 ​
 These technicians shouldnt be dopes reading from a script, but rather subject matter experts.
 ​
 Obviously such a thing shouldnt spy on you and it should have privacy measures built in.

                <p>Hello everyone!

This release brings a lot of quality of life improvements like using the correct cache directory of OS to store state, returning correct exit code on job failure, new subcommands like list packages and clean-cache, new environment variables available during build RECIPE RECIPE_VERSION RECIPE_RELEASE, and a lot more! 
 For a full changelog check out this link: https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md 
 And here is the user&#x27;s guide: https://vv9k.github.io/pkger/

                <p>I haven&#x27;t been using Linux a long time and one of my favorite things growing up was surfing source forge when it was still good for new and interesting projects anything from large mega projects to small shell scripts. I just think it would be awesome if there was a show or site that just did a feature on that project and maybe gave history and a deep dive on that program and I promise I did Google before I posted here.

                <p>Like the title mentioned above, I just want everyone&#x27;s favourite part about using a distribution. Not the best point mentioned about a distribution on their website. Although that could your favourite part. 
 No, I&#x27;m also talking about the small things that was by default in your distribution or maybe unique to your distribution. I want to know all that. This is just for general knowledge. I&#x27;m not looking for advice for a new distribution.
 Like for example, as far as I know PoP OS is only one which dynamically switches between nvidia and intel graphics card thus providing an option exactly like windows. In other distros you have to use prime-run or optimus manager or nvidia-xrun. Stuff like that.
 Thanks in advance for indulging me.
 PS I don&#x27;t use pop OS. Just meant that as an example. I use Arch BTW 😂. And my favourite points are the option to build from from sratch and to build as light or heavy as you want. And the AUR was also a godsend. But I am now switching to Gentoo because I&#x27;m intrigued by it&#x27;s unique concept of compilation every time and changing the source code to remove the parts irrelevant to your needs.

                <p>Hi,
 I&#x27;m installing openSUSE Leap 15.3. I can&#x27;t decide between BTRFS and LVM-ext4. I know that BTRFS has a lot of amazing features, like snapshots and compression, but I need something rock stable that will never ever break. So far, ext4 has been 100% reliable for me. I don&#x27;t want to do any kind of BTRFS-related system maintenance. If BTRFS is not at least as stable and reliable as ext4, I&#x27;ll stick to LVM-ext4. Even if the chance of it breaking is 0.01%, I&#x27;ll stick to LVM-ext4. From what I read, it seems that BTRFS is not stable enough for my needs, but the information seems to be a little dated. So, is BTRFS as stable and reliable as ext4 in 2021?

                <p>My issue is that all my games that aren&#x27;t big titles like apex, siege, overwatch, even it takes 2 and halo infinite run fine, it just keep crashing immediately as they load or right after I start to play or after a bit. The games that I really have issues with is escape from tarkov, call of duty warzone, split gate, a plague tale. Tarkov crashes consist of the game screen going black but I can still move and do stuff but not see for less than a minute then it crashes and I have to task Manger it about %90 of the time to close it or it won&#x27;t close on its own, other games just completely closes the game almost immediately. Never goes to a blue screen or anything, it just closes the games out.
 I&#x27;ve tried overclocking my gpu under clocking, allocating each drive with virtual ram, used DDU to delete drivers, I ran windows memory diagnostic, disabled xmp, thought it cpuld be my psu so I ran furmarks cpu and gpu stress tests at the same time for 10 minutes and both were at %100 usage and nothing happened. I&#x27;m loosing my damn mind trying to figure this out. I have a ryzen 5 3600 tomahawk b450 asus gtx1080ti corsair vengeance right pro 16gb (2x8)
 I just reinstalled windows and deleted all portions and am still having the same issues. So my question is would switching to linux possibly get rid of this issue?

                <p>With all the new 470 Nvidia drivers, Gnome 40 and so on is there a proper solution for using external monitor connected to the Nvidia-Optimus laptop where all the output ports are wired to the NV card? I&#x27;ve been waiting for it for so long time sitting on Windows that I&#x27;m not sure if someone came up with something brilitiant on the matter. I tried the new Solus lately (MATE, GNOME) with 470 drivers and the thing is still in the woods. The newest driver supposed to support Wayland which was supposed to be the remedy for the slow animations while using external displays but the current state still is that the external display does not work on Wayland. It&#x27;s infuriating so much. Besides how the hell the nouveau drivers are able to maintain smooth UI animations on both screens (internal 144hz and external 60hz) and the proprietary drivers cannot (minus some tearing on nouveau drivers)?

                <p>I grew up during the days of Windows 9x, 2000, and XP so I am really fond of the ever popular classic theme for Windows. I also really love Linux and really do not want to go back to Windows as my daily if I can at all help it.
 So I decided to marry the best of both worlds. This is my 2012 laptop running Linux Mint 20.2 running the Windows 9x theme made by b00merang over on GitHub. It gets very close to looking like the Windows classic theme. So much so that it has actually fooled me a couple times when I was not paying attention.
 I even installed Microsoft Office for Windows 95 through Wine to complete the look. Even in 2021, its still a fairly decent word processor. I actually do use it.

                <p>I have had a spirited discussion on why we think it is or isn&#x27;t.
 I say it is the kernel that matters (outdated doesn&#x27;t matter since I don&#x27;t have any use changes this comment seems to agree, even with older versions, it can run GNU software, it has reached better than partiality in terms of software, can chroot, runs x11 and may not run an ARM version of every exact software but other options including open source software I have used have been found. Choice in a well supported Android device will yield an excellent Linux experience (such as unlocked bootloader, custom recovery, and root), mainline support is always being added, and many can run UBtouch, PMOS, and custom roms.
 The argument against it is that it is not a distro of GNU/Linux with a mainline vanilla kernel; it is ACK, has a lack of updates, which come in the form of patched old kernels, has proprietary software like skins or custom UI, also usually added google services and apps, not compatible with the exact ARM version of the package. The hardware and software is often locked, you cannot usually replace parts, and newer apps may need newer versions of Android.
 What do you think? (I know the PinePhone and Librem5 exist, but they are hardware downgrades to my current hardware).

                <p>I&#x27;ve been using Linux for a couple of years and am able to get things working how I want and fix most issues with the help of Google. When I read people discussing the kernel, window managers etc. I just get completely lost.
 I find it really interesting though and would like to develop a deep understanding of how everything works together to create the distributions we use.
 How did you all develop your Linux knowledge? Was it just years of playing around? Formal training? Does anyone have any learning resources they can recommend?

                <p>Hi,
 Sort of an unusual question I guess.
 I am running a Qt-based modular custom built desktop environment. Among the modules is an integrated media player.
 So what I want to do is to register this media player as the default to play music and videos, for example, by double clicking the file in any file manager.
 I kind of know how registering default applications work, but my case is special in the sense that the application isn&#x27;t standalone, and as such I need a different approach.
 I guess I could develop a little program that always runs in the background that serves as the &#x27;default application&#x27;, and sends any file URLs it receives to the media player using DBus. Or perhaps set the desktop environment as the default and do it from there.
 What would you recommend?

                <p>So I&#x27;ve been trying to prune down all the cruft, bloat, and unused system components my laptop has built up over the years, and in the process I re-discovered the &quot;two-state system&quot; that is the Linux Audio Stack.
 All I personally want out of my audio stack is to be able to have sound come from all my programs, and to go to either my speakers, Bluetooth or USB headsets without having to write more than a few dozen lines of config for each. 
 It seems that it used to be what you needed Pulse for, but the most recent threads I could find were like four years old, and even then seemed to be saying that things were changing, what with ALSA now implementing software mixing through extensions (which are now included in the default install, I think). 
 Further, I discovered other options. JACK has been around for a while, and PipeWire seems to have just shown up recently. So when you need more than ALSA maybe there&#x27;s more than one game in town now.
 Curious what the advantages/disadvantages are for a pure ALSA stack, what extensions/configurations you need to make it work best, and finally if there&#x27;s anything that it seems it still just can&#x27;t do.

                <p>So I have been seeing a lot of talk on youtube about Gardua which I know is based on Arch. However, I really don&#x27;t see the hype about it being pretty and fast because honestly I find the neon color scheme a bit ugly or just a eye sore I just don&#x27;t know. Personally I prefer Budgie, Gnome, and Plasma (I love Unity though :[ ). 
 That said I would try Gardua but I don&#x27;t want to make the jump to Arch partially because I am lazy and the last time I used Arch they rarely if ever had GUI installers and I prefer stability over rolling-releases and am super fluent with dpkg and apt.

                <p>Many people in the Windows world will tell you that Windows XP was one of the absolute best Windows OSes ever released, notably due to it being packed with features while requiring VERY little system resources. Specifically, assuming you had the max 4 GB of RAM on the 32-bit version of XP, it would use only ~105 MB of that. If you put some RAM pressure on the OS, it would scale down even more to ~75 MB. Ever since Vista&#x27;s release though, that number skyrocketed all the way up to ~850 MB with 4 GB of RAM with it scaling down to its lowest of ~215 MB when memory pressure is applied.
 Now, I know exactly what everyone&#x27;s going to type now. RAM was not nearly as plentiful back then as it is now, and free RAM is unused RAM, which is actually bad because it&#x27;s not getting used to its fullest poten…</p>

 eg- sudo snap install vlc 
 eg- sudo apt install obs-studio
 How do I know which words to use to install software packages?

                <p>Im at loss for words, I’m not sure what the hell is going on but for some reason my USBs are suddenly becoming undetected. Brand new ones as well. Each USB port is still fully-functional; my wired USB hotspot works, USB-wireless mouse, USB-wireless keyboard, etc. Luckily, 2 of my USBs can still be read, but 4 have become undetected, and out of those 4, 2 of them are brand NEW. And the light will still switch on when they’re plugged in? What the fuck could be going on? 
 Sorry to come off a bit on edge, but those 2 USBs have really important data on em(luckily I have most of it backed up), but it’s just starting to get infuriating. I figured maybe they could’ve gotten corrupt, so I bought 2 more to replace them and they read fine, then suddenly it’s just like disappeared. And now I’m nervous plug any USB flash drive in. What could be going on? Any advice? 
 As stated, I have sensitive data that I would like to have backed up. I really dislike having a potential single point of failure, especially if there could be some strange hardware malfunction/cfg. Thank you all in advance.
 Don’t think it’ll matter but just in case….. OS; Parrot OS MATE, kern.5.10

                <p>Hi! I have an HP spectre x360 with kaby lake from 2017, and noticed that acpi reports that the &quot;last full capacity&quot; is the same as the design capacity, i.e. 100%. 
 It is safe to say that the machine has gone through many charging cycles and has spent many working days being plugged in the entire day. It certainly is not at 100% anymore, and I&#x27;ve been considering a replacement battery. 
 I assume there is some way to calibrate the capacity readings to get the right health info. Would anyone here be willing to tell me how? :) 
 I use EndeavorOS, and &quot;acpi -bi&quot; to check in on the battery.

                <p>Celluloid, it&#x27;s the definition of &quot;it just werks&quot; most intuitive and easy gui, no wonder it&#x27;s the default choice of Linux Mint (I use audacious separately for audio only content) 
 Not to say VLC and the other are bad, but UI-wise celluloid stands out and the format support is excellent too

                <p>The first time I met this guy, he wasn&#x27;t really like a big tech guru or anything. He wishes to become a lawyer, but when he discovered that I was a huge fan of Linux he really wanted to give it a try. I showed him a few distributions to choose from, which obviously were beginner-friendly. He liked Ubuntu the most, and he hated Windows so much that he wanted to erase the whole disk and only have Linux on his drive.
 We ran into a couple of issues here and there, mostly related to missing libraries. Surprisingly he actually had a lot of fun trying to troubleshoot and fix, and he hasn&#x27;t stopped thanking me for introducing him to GNU/Linux. Hope we see more people like this person in the future, so that we can grow the Linux community and get more people off the atrocious platform of Windows.

                <p>Hello,
 I am thinking about switching to sway. Unfortunately, possessing an nvidia card (GTX 1050), I will have to install the nouveau driver since the proprietary nvidia drivers are not supported.
 The problem is that I am unable to know if it is worth it since the only sources I was able to find, when comparing the open source and the proprietary driver, date back back to at least 2 years (seams a bit outdated).
 I don&#x27;t play, I only code on my computer. So apart from coding, I sometimes watch movies, listen to spotify. So, to sum it up, I don&#x27;t really use my GPU. The most &quot;demanding&quot; piece of software I use is picom.
 So as a final question, I would like to know if I will feel any downside switching to sway ? Is it worth the try ?
 Thank you very much for your help.

                <p>Hi, I was just thinking about the best way to protect your data from ransomware, mistakes, and other mishaps. It seems there should be a filesystem or block device replication system that works like database replication. For example in PostgreSQL you enable transaction logging to another server and take a base backup, then to restore to any point in time you just need the base backup plus all the logs from the backup time to the point in time where you need to recover.
 Is there a block device driver or filesystem that does something similar? I&#x27;m not aware of it. I don&#x27;t think DRBD goes that far. I hear ZFS might provide some of that, but I&#x27;d like to see something whose legality is not in dispute.

                <p>Semi-begginer here. I dipped my toes into Linux a while ago, and I learned all the basics, like commands that I need for file exploration/installing stuff. What now?
 I want to learn more about the system and what I can do with it, but I have no clue where to go from here. Any recommendations for projects, or maybe even a different distro (since I intially picked Ubuntu since I heard it was the most beginner friendly), or just general recourses I can look into. Anything would be appreciated!

                <p>Hey. So Ive been using Linux on and off for about 2 years and fulltime for 1 year. My experience has been great and I was wondering if anyone shares some of my thoughts.
 I get the impression that people always assume Linux is a geek os that isnt a viable Windows replacement for the average user. Whenever I show them my PC and they see how its intuitive, functional and good looking they often like it.
 So Ive always been someone that enjoys messing around with computers, I like them to get stuff done and make my life eassier but I have absolutely no idea about coding or advanced stuff. Given I know much more than the average person but I know nothing compared to most Linux people. 
 Well, when I heard about Linux for the first time I was intrigued by the concept of FOSS software, I couldnt…</p>

                <p>Hi All,
 I am pretty greenie when it comes to Linux but I love it, along with the whole open source culture. I want to start learning it to make a career out of it but can’t find the most appropriate path to go from zero (well, from junior) to a respected Linux Engineer. I have limited time but I am willing to use it to learn and follow the right track. Please share your thoughts.

 For something a little different, this is Linux (ELKS 0.4) running on my PC XT replica.
 This is an open-hardware machine, fairly easy to build although it takes some soldering and troubleshooting skills. The VGA card in particular uses a large SMD IC which might take several tries to solder right.
  
CPU: Intel 8088 overclocked from 4.77MHz to 8MHz
 RAM: 640KB minus the reserved segments, mostly for the VGA framebuffer. VGA is overkill for an XT/AT and wastes some precious upper memory so I will switch to CGA once I receive my HDMI conversion board (basically just an FPGA with connectors).
 Disk: Compact Flash with IDE adapter. Dual boot with MSDOS 3.3 through bootable flag. The filesystem used is Minix v1.
  
The kernel is built with a TCP/IP stack, but I don&#x27;t have an ISA ethernet card yet to test it.
 The userland ships with some nice utilities including a micro httpd server, an IRC client and more.
 It&#x27;s obviously fairly slow and a bit of a memory hog once booted (160KB) compared to MSDOS, being written in C instead of 8086 assembly. However it&#x27;s really fun to bring Linux to 40 years old PCs.

                <p>Suppose I want to run a script, a command or a generic executable. Is there a way to prevent said process accessing files outside the current working directory?
 I know there is chroot, but it&#x27;s not very ergonomic because one has to prepare the virtual environment with all the dependencies.
 macOS has a nice (but limited) feature that restricts access to common user directories (desktop, documents and so on) showing a dialog the first time a process is trying to access something inside these folders.
 I guess I&#x27;m looking for a sandbox runtime like the one provided by deno and its Permission API
 It is probably possible to achieve something similar using docker containers and mounting only specific volumes, I tried this by it wasn&#x27;t good enough, the configuration wasn&#x27;t trivial.
 I&#x27;m wondering if there is something at the system level to achieve this with as little overhead as possible, both in terms of resources and time to configure.
 ​
 For those interested in the &quot;Why&quot;: when a user launches a process, it runs with the user permissions by default, thus it&#x27;s able to read from (and write to) the file system just like a user is. This is something that really makes me uncomfortable because it means a malicious script/program can easily steal my ssh keys, not to mention all my personal and/or confidential data.

                <p>Hi, our team working on amdfand is curious how many of Linux + AMD users do have multiple GPU, what kind of GPU are they so I want to ask people here what kind for setup they have? 
 Is this hybrid nVidia + AMD, nVidia + nVidia or there are people with AMD + AMD?

                <p>I&#x27;ve been using Linux as my only operating system for about six years now, and I would consider myself to be fairly okay in my understanding of how a system works, although I&#x27;m not formally trained in computers. (I have a background in theoretical cs, but that&#x27;s it). I have completed and used LFS as my primary distro for a couple of months as well, and one of my personal projects involved writing a full basic userspace implementation from scratch in C. All of these were for fun and learning.
 But as I&#x27;m going for my PhD (in math), I just realised that I would like to have a secondary source of income, as the university fundings would barely cover my living expenses in a foreign country (US). 
 So I was wondering if there was any opportunities for someone like me, with no formal training in system administration or programming, or any certification (they&#x27;re expensive) to get any kind of part time job? I&#x27;m willing to learn anything as long as it&#x27;s free.
 (Sorry if this is not the appropriate sub. Please let me know)

                <p>There’s usually more than one way to code a thing in React. And while it’s possible to create the same thing different ways, there may be one or two approaches that technically work “better” than others. I actually run into …

                <p>I have nothing against Debian, nor Ubuntu, but why would I use Mint, in stead of Ubuntu or Pop, the difference seems to be quite small. At least with Arch and Manjaro the one is a bit more DIY with the other focusing on accessibility. All these other distros have one thing or another that’s different, like gentoo with its portage or kali Linux with the hacker-stuff in mind, but with the first three mentioned (although I don’t doubt there are way more) it just seems like Debian with a slightly different skin. Am I missing something?
 Cheers.

                <p>DIACLAMER TO MODS: Before you ban me for self promotion, I just want to say that r/linux is the only way I can show my hard work and effort so please be patient.
 Hello, Linux Redditors! I&#x27;m making this distribution for people who want to boot Linux with their files on almost any computer. Not just that but making Gaming is also a big focus on this distro. It&#x27;s Tails/Debian based so software isn&#x27;t a problem. The preinstalled software list is so far made up by Steam, Wine, NVIDIA Control Panel (in the NVIDIA version), and GIMP.
 There are 2 versions with 2 variations possible - Standard - Extra Pre-installed software Edition
  
Normal Variation
 NVIDIA Variation
  
If there is anything that I could add or change I would be happy of you wrote it it the comments.
 I do not expect this post to blow up so to the few that see this, Hello and thank you for listening to my idea! :)

                <p>I have a story to share about how i started using linux, it was actually the first os that i used. I remember that i started with linux when i was around 6-7! it was in 2013 (yes i’m a zoomer) and i remember i used ubuntu 12.10 because i got an old laptop from my grandparents and dad installed it until we buy a new windows license (the computer had windows xp that just broke). Dad was teaching me some shell commands and helping me repair stuff that broke on it. all i can say is that i have learned a lot of stuff and that i’m grateful that i started on linux. i have used it until this day dualbooted with windows (for some games not supporting wine)

                <p>I have heard some people use wm&#x27;s such as xmonad or i3 mainly due to multi monitor support. However, is there any advantages to using a wm on a laptop? The screens are usually small and opening windows side to side would only make the windows smaller and smaller. 
 Not to mention having to configure all the F keys to actually lower brightness and volume has been a pain in my experience. Am I using these wrong? What are your thoughts?

                <p>My personal choice would be Thunderbird. Coupled with Lightning and TBSync extensions it becomes a full drop-in replacement for Outlook. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it made me completely forget about its proprietary counterpart, yet over the years it has been struggling to see continued development. I am interested in knowing other FOSS projects which you find particularly valuable or that you personally support on a ongoing basis.

                <p>Hey all.
 As per the title, I have taken on a project of creating a small introduction booklet for my works (we sell refurbished PC&#x27;s, or at least we do now myself and my colleague are there, the place used to just sell clothes, furniture and bric-a-brac), where most of the customers have never even heard of Linux let alone used it.
 Any PC we sell that is below a comfortable, responsive install of Windows 10 gets a lightly customised version of BunsenLabs installed on it. While it isn&#x27;t the most pretty or user-friendly Linux out there it is one of the lightest. Being light weight was a huge factor in deciding what flavour we went for as the main machine criteria is a Core 2 Duo/Quad CPU with 4GB RAM and a 160GB HDD. Q4OS with the Trinity desktop was another consideration but it turned out…</p>

                <p>I know Android is a very different &quot;distro&quot;, but considering it runs on the Linux kernel and has some similarities, I was thinking how big of an effort companies would need to make to port their apps. Would it require major code rewrites or just some library substitutions? Is it easier to go from Android to Linux, Windows to Linux, or Windows to Android (or the other way around)? Note I&#x27;m talking about native apps, no VM or compatibility layer involved. This question sprang to my mind after I noticed some companies maintain 6 different versions of the same app. 
 I only know how to program OS-agnostic CLI programs yet.

                <p>As a life long windows user, im very familiar with the layout of Windows. I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of videos about the linux OS and have been really interested in using it (Deepin) as my daily driver. I use FL Studio as my DAW of choice. I&#x27;ve used it for years and absolutely love it, but it does not work on Linux. Is it worth switching to Linux? or should i just update to windows. I dont know if this is the best place to ask a question like this as i may get some biased responses, so please try to stay open-minded.

                <p>Received a job offer/interview for having a background in linux and an active DOD security clearance. Problem is this is a mid level job opportunity and im at best entry level for linux network experience. Is this a dumb dream of a 19yr old or should I bite the bullet and reach 4 it. I have studied for linux plus, daily drive debian 10.10 and am fairly versed in setting up CISCO routers and switches via command line. But i dont want to promise anything out of my scope or skill set. 
 There aren&#x27;t many applicants maybe 3 and it couldn&#x27;t hurt to reply back 
 a career in Linux is the dream any job in IT is the goal
 Any current linux system admins out there ?

                <p>Not long ago, as some of you may be aware, Adobe purchased Allegorithmic. Which meant that they now had Substance 3D, an overall excellent and top of the class tool for 3D work and CGI. This suite was, to my knowledge, always native for Linux with no issues.
 Will this change as Adobe has fully rebranded Substance Suite into its messy arsenal of some of the best software in each field? From their FAQ on their official website, Linux builds are not available through Adobe&#x27;s subscription, only available on Steam&#x27;s perpetual version.
  
Linux builds of the Substance apps aren’t available via Individual Adobe Substance 3D subscriptions. At this point the Linux version is only available on Steam for Substance Painter &amp; Substance Designer. For Teams &amp; Enterprise plans on Adobe.com, please contact [sales@substance3d.com](mailto:sales@substance3d.com).
  
I won&#x27;t be naive, they won&#x27;t sell any more perpetual licenses from now on. Does this signify the end of practical, efficient and stable 3D texture development on Linux? I love Blender and I use it for work, but there is no practical, affordable and high quality alternative to Substance 3D. Blender just doesn&#x27;t cut it.
 It seems like a pointless move to remove Linux support, but oh well.

                <p>Today I wondered if I could change the colors of the progress bar apt shows when installing/removing packages.
 Turns out, you can, and it&#x27;s only kinda fiddly.
 Man pages have been unhelpful in this, and the only information I could find on this is from when Ubuntu 14.04 was the latest, so apt may have changed slightly since then, but I got things working how I want.
 You&#x27;ll need to create a file at /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99progressbar, (permissions 644) and add the following:
 Dpkg::Progress-Fancy &quot;1&quot;; Dpkg::Progress-Fancy::Progress-Bg &quot;%1b[**m&quot;; Dpkg::Progress-Fancy::Progress-Fg &quot;%1b[**m&quot;; 
 Where ** is an ANSI color code number. For example, for white text on blue background, I used 37 for Bg and 44 for Fg.
 These seem to be reversed from what I thought they should be, according to this ANSI color code table. But I&#x27;m just fumbling my way through this anyhow.
 Anybody know if there are any more options for making apt prettier?

                <p>Title explains it all. I&#x27;m going to create a terminal file manager just for fun, so if you have any ideas for features or anything, write it below. So far I have 2 criteria: 
  
Must be fast (~1-2ms startup)
 Should show file previews
  
Should I write it in: Rust or C? What other features would a user like to see?

                <p>I recently distro hopped to linux and I am wondering, which desktop envirement looks the best by default such as KDE, XFCE, Gnome, Cinnamon or maybe even some other envirement that look good. Personally I decided on XFCE due to its simplicity as well as its customizability but what have you chosen. But I know XFCE isn&#x27;t very pretty out of the box on some installations.

                <p>I&#x27;ve been looking at learning some RHEL or Suse lately and one thing that I&#x27;ve noticed, especially in the Suse world. Is that the default desktop for workstation/desktop variants is Gnome. Anyone know why this is? I could kind of understand with RHEL as Fedora is Gnome and they don&#x27;t have a large KDE history as far as I know, but Suse along with openSuse does a heap of KDE work and openSuse itself defaults to KDE as the standard desktop.
 It would also seem ideal to use KDE for enterprise desktops as Windows users would find the UI a lot more intuitive than Gnome&#x27;s.

                <p>So I&#x27;ve been using Windows 7 and 10 for as long as i can remember, its like my home. Unfortunately Microsoft is taking away that in 2025. I was going to go Windows 11 but my computer hardware is too old (Custom Build). So i decided to go with linux. I have been very hesitant because i want my games to work, to switch all my data over with no lose, and be comfortable with it. I understand change is hard and scary. I know there shouldn&#x27;t be much i should be scared of but it just keeps nagging me and i keep delaying the installation. I wanted to go with Pop OS but im not sure. I would like some support to help me move over, and if there is any tips i would gladly listen and take the advice.

                <p>Hello all so I find myself with a bit of an issue. I have a Dell 3070 that I just install pop os on. Wanted to finally dive deeper into using Linux and liked what I saw.
 long story short I thought I had things set. Was performing the final restart after the install. And suddenly the bios could not find a bootable drive. No idea why, not sure what happened. I have a 500 gb SSD also in the machine so I thought welp. Did an install there, but this time I didn&#x27;t encrypt the drive. 
 Any one have an idea on formatting the drive as it sits in this system? even during the install for some reason the drive would not show up as a possible install location. The bios does see it though.
 If you need more info let me know.

                <p>UPDATE I was able to get it changed! Thanks everyone
 A client has a vm that they refuse to get rid of and doesn&#x27;t know the password and we need to reset the password and need the iso to do so. Haven&#x27;t been able to find it online anywhere since it&#x27;s a million years old.

                <p>Hi all, I just got to experience the Linux OS through playing ard with virtual Ubuntu and kali linux and thought of getting a Linux OS laptop as I heard many good things about the Linux OS. Is that a good idea? 
 Just wondering , will familiarising myself with the Linux OS help me in entering a tech job, specifically, a cybersecurity job?

                <p>I know that the question does not go much with the theme of the group, but maybe someone knows an app or service that can help me.
 I have a raspberry pi4 and i would like to use it from my tablet with termux.
  
SSH is not an option since the latency when opening vim + tmux is considerable(slow).
 I thought of using sshfs but it is not possible with termux.
 Although I don&#x27;t like it, I also tried vscode (code-server) but it doesn&#x27;t have support for ssh functionality
  
For now, configure my raspi to work with git-shell and use it as a kind of CI/CD server. But this is useful when you have concrete implementations in your code and not when you are developing it :( They know a better way to be able to use a raspi from termux

                <p>In my humble opinion I think linux giving to much focus on the kernel and they success on the kernel development. What do all of you think if linux start their own linux bios. A bios that can be flash to desktop and notebook and importantly open source. The bios will have no problem integration with linix kernel and distro.
 Whenever manufacturer only focus on making bios for windows integration the user like us have the freedom to flashing an open source bios based on linux to the system.

                <p>Hi all, 
 YSK that there is a cool piece of software that offers most of the features of Evernote, and they have made a native version for Linux. Nice to see that they have done this, whereas Evernote simply cannot be arsed. 
 Check them out - notesnook.com

                <p>Hi folks!
 We&#x27;re looking for a headset for Zoom meetings ($30-$100) that&#x27;s compatible with Ubuntu.
 We tried Microsoft Lifechat 3000 headphones, and while they were fine in Windows, Ubuntu absolutely refuses to connect to them.
 Can anyone recommend something?
 (I thought perhaps to only use headsets with 3.5mm, not USB, to make sure it&#x27;s compatible... but if you know of any USB headsets, that would be better and more convenient.)

                <p>Howdy r/linux, I use FLOSS editors for my work like GIMP, Inkscape, FontForge, Krita, Blender and OpenShot on daily basis. But I would love to expand my toolkit and explore new options. I mean these tools work very well, just that I was looking to explore something niche and cool. Btw, I use Arch (MATE).
 What tools would you recommend for graphic and video editors that either similar to the popular ones or have unique features that the other don&#x27;t have? Thank you for your answers. Have a great week.

                <p>I&#x27;m just now learning how to use Linux and I&#x27;m finding it more helpful to get accustomed to the terminal by trying to install useful programs for customizing Linux. Is there anything out there thats pretty cool that I should download that would help me do more customization? I had to download something just to set up separate wallpapers for my dual monitors.
 I&#x27;m using the Ubuntu distro.
