                <p>Hey everyone!
 ​
 I&#x27;m thinking about trying out Linux but I&#x27;m legally blind and thus rely on a screen reader for computer use. I&#x27;d like to hear some opinions on Orca from those of you who&#x27;ve tried it/used it extensively, since as far as I know, my current screen reader of choice (NVDA) is only compatible with Windows. How well does it handle programs such as Tor, Thunderbird, LibreOffice or VLC?
 ​
 Thanks for the answers in advance!

                <p>Something that holds me back from committing to most distros is the fact that I don&#x27;t know if I can trust them with my privacy and personal information. 
 There are so many out there, and I can&#x27;t help but feel like a few of them should not be trusted. I could just be paranoid, but I&#x27;ve been a lot more privacy-focused lately so this is always on my mind. 
 How do you tell whether or not you can trust a distro?

                <p>Edit: also shout out to the guys down below really helping me find other solutions here. still wont solve everything but its a start.
 So with the windows 11 looming over head and me having 5 years to try to get over to a Linux OS I&#x27;m quickly realizing why Linux just cant get a market share going cause developers literally make their proprietary software only work in windows like their intentionally creating a enforced windows monopoly.
 I cant use my k95 and icue nexus on Linux cause the icue software is windows only and corsair literally doesn&#x27;t give a shit about anything but windows.
 cant use my SoundBlaster G6 cause the software is literally windows only.
 sure there&#x27;s RGB open source software to at least customize the lighting but good luck for macro programming and touch screen programming. and good luck customizing your audio on your DAC. i swear to god I&#x27;m gonna have to buy all new hardware that&#x27;s Linux compatible from the get go once i transition to linux I&#x27;m never looking back to windows.
 but like there&#x27;s so many companies with proprietary software for their hardware that it really just feels like its just forcing people with media entertainment as their focus to stay on windows once you already purchased the hardware cause your not gonna wana just give it up cause sometimes this shit costs hundreds of dollars.
 TLDR i think i finally figured out why people hate windows so much from the linux perspective. its just hostile to new users not so much from the interface or learning how to use the os, its the proprietary software for hardware that makes it hard from someone to switch without buying new stuff unless someone was extremely nice enough to donate their time to make a reverse engineered version of it.

                <p>Hi everybody, I&#x27;m working on a command-line utility for GNU/Linux distributions based on x64, I&#x27;ve called it AppMan (Application Manager) and works like Pacman or Apt, but using only standalone applications (no shared libraries to prevent conflict with dependencies), in particular AppImages, most of them updatable.
 The installer includes three AppImages: appimageupdate (to update AppImages), pkg2appimage (to convert deb packages in AppDir folders) and appimagetool (to convert AppDir in AppImages). All the actions and the binary files are installed in /opt/bin.
 Usage
 appman [option] or appman [option] [argument]
 where option include:
 -h , help Print this message.
 -a [argument], about [argument] Show basic info on each application, link to the website and/or the source and how to update some applications.
 -c, clean Remove all unnecessary files and folders, i.e. backup files, installation scripts, and temporary folders zip or deb packages.
 -f, files Programs installed on the system.
 -i [argument], install [argument] Install a program. It can be used to update... non-updatable programs too (see -u, update).
 -l, list Shows the list of apps available in the repository.
 -r [argument], remove [argument] Removes a program (requires confirmation, default is N).
 -s, sync Updates the list of available apps.
 -u, update Update AppImages using &#x27;appimageupdate&#x27;, if the update info is embedded into the AppImage itself by the developer.
 The link to the repository is this: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan
 The list of available apps is here, I&#x27;ve also provided some templates for you to modify the way you like (here). Any pull request is welcomed.
 ​
 I hope you enjoy it.

                <p>So perfect. Downloading complete albums of &quot;stuff that&#x27;s.. well stuff&quot; running in tmux with youtube-dl -i mode for newer failing and just continue on. 
 Anyone have my same use case?

                <p>They add nothing of value to this sub. We get it, embedded systems run on Linux. It&#x27;s not even interesting stuff being shared, but billboard after billboard. Tell me nuclear missiles run on Linux and you got my attention, otherwise it&#x27;s not surprising at all.

                <p>I&#x27;ve been using Ubutu as my daily OS for the past 8 years and am a big fan of Linux in general. Just wondering what you think could improve about it. Is there anything that bothers you on a regular basis? any examples of backward- compatibility hindering user experience?

                <p>Most distros, especially the most popular ones (with a few exceptions) choose Gnome as the default DE. Some of them have editions with different desktop environments, but they aren&#x27;t the default and are seen as alternatives. What could explain that? Gnome&#x27;s simplicity and quality? Licensing? Politics? Easier integration? Historical reasons?

                <p>I have been using Manjaro for about 2 years. The first year I was using packages from repositories and Manjaro felt unstable. I had to reboot pc regularly to “fix” things and I reinstalled Manjaro 2 times in that time. After that I started using flatpaks for everything. I even uninstalled preinstalled apps and installed flatpak versions instead. I have had zero problems since. Steam is the only thing that is not installed as flatpak, for obvious reasons.
 Does anybody else have similar experience?
 I&#x27;m kind of considering moving to Solus. The only reason I was using Manjaro was AUR, but I have only one package installed from there, and I barely use it.

                <p>I just want to write about my road to GNU/Linux and FOSS, hope it&#x27;s allowed in this community. I&#x27;m studying electronic engineer, so I have a few years of c and c# coding and I like to tinker a lot. 
 It all started in my last year of highschool when the need to try and start knowing something about Linux showed on. The only opinion I had was my father&#x27;s, an SQL server developer married with Microsoft, telling me there&#x27;s no support at all, nothing works, etc. I first tried the &quot;mainstream&quot; ones, Pop! OS, Linux mint cinnamon, Manjaro KDE (never tried Ubuntu though). I had no knowledge at all, was software pinned (using Solidworks, Altium and others of this type because of the school) and I did install it on a notebook hdd so performance was not the best, so I quit. 
 Next year (this year, Ma…</p>

                <p>To preface, I never used Linux regularly. Back in high school and college nearly a dozen years ago, I kept a Linux install on my laptop so that I could use Aircrack-ng to get free WiFi since Aircrack-ng didn&#x27;t work on Windows. (This was when WEP was still extremely prevalent for wireless networks.) After getting the password, I would switch to Windows. I used Ubuntu back then, thought GNOME was slow and awful, and switched to XFCE instead. 
 However, as WEP went away and WPA looked like more of an effort to crack (dictionary attacks look like they took too long), I stopped using Linux and haven&#x27;t really touched it since. 
 Recently though, I decided to give Linux a spin after hearing news about the Steam Deck and how SteamOS is switching to Arch. I installed a copy of Kubuntu on my Thinkpa…</p>

 Blog post✒️: https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2021/09/07/OpenSSL3.Final/
 Here is an excerpt from the blog post:
  
After 3 years of development work, 17 alpha releases, 2 beta releases, over 7,500 commits and contributions from over 350 different authors we have finally released OpenSSL 3.0! In addition to this there has been a large number of contributions from our users who have been actively working with the pre-release versions to test it, make sure it works in the real world and with a large array of different applications and reporting their results. I am also delighted to note that there has been a 94% increase in the amount of documentation that we have since OpenSSL 1.1.1 and an (adjusted) increase in the “lines of code” in our tests of 54%. There has never been a better demonstration of what an active and enthusiastic community we have than when you look at the statistics for the OpenSSL 3.0 development work. Thanks to everyone who has taken part - no matter how small that part was.

                <p>PSA
 There is a HUGE bug in all openSUSE distributions (Leap, Tumbleweed, Factory, etc) for unzip. It seems to consist on an unpatched CVE from 2013. Unzip will randomly change a file when extracting into a symlink, breaking it.
 Since unzip is used for deployment pipelines and applications, this has the potential to affect a lot of users and workflows, and may have subtly broken a lot of things all these years!
 This same bug was fixed and patched in other distributions such as Debian since 2013.

                <p>Just curious to see what the linux community
  
Thinks about &quot;commercial&quot; linux based phones (like Pinephone)
 Knows about them? As in what&#x27;s out there?
  
Looking to move from android at some point, but looking for some pointers from the experts?

                <p>The move to the service(8) command and later systemctl(1) commands for managing daemons/services really has been a step back in UI functionality from a systems administration perspective. That is compared to just exploring the files via the filesystem at /etc/init.d/ using them like /etc/init.d/ntpd restart. Most systems out of the box aren&#x27;t setup with proper shell completion for systemctl and service commands. That means you have to remember complex commands to even know what your system is running to begin with. 
 How was this allowed to happen and do people consider it more user friendly?

                <p>In attempt to bring a QR code scanner application to Linux phone (PureOS, Pinephone), I updated my CoBang app with libhandy to make its UI responsive (v0.9.0).
 Desktop view
 ​
 Mobile view
 However this is just the first step. I don&#x27;t have any Linux phone so I don&#x27;t know how it looks like in real devices and what other changes to make. It would be nice if someone can help.
 For now, only Ubuntu 21.04 package is available (cannot support older Ubuntu because of Libhandy v1 dependency). Other packages for ArchLinux, Fedora may come later (those are done by ArchLinux &amp; Fedora community). It would be nice if someone help package for Flatpak (it is tiresome to me because of having to write build script for dependencies).

                <p>Disclaimer: This enables a feature that is disabled by default, if you are experiencing render issues make sure to remember how to turn in off again!
 I have an AMD GPU that uses the amdgpu driver, if you are not using MESA drivers your experience may vary!
 Some people are experiencing shorter battery life / worse performance when browsing the Web on Linux. Some if it may well be because Chrome to this day (Version 93) still disables GPU accelerated video decode by default.
 To check it for yourself, go to chrome://gpu/ - if everything there is green for you, great! You can stop reading this post.
 If you, like me, find both &quot;Video Decode&quot; and &quot;Rasterization&quot; to be &quot;Software only&quot; and want to change that, keep reading. I noticed most of the &quot;Problems Detected&quot; are more than a decade old and even stem from the fglrx driver. So just because AMD had terrible drivers in the past, Chrome still plays it safe and does not touch hardware acceleration to avoid breaking some fringe configuration!
 But MESA drivers are pretty good now, let&#x27;s get rid of that blacklist:
  
Enable the Hardware Accelerated Video Decode flag in chrome://flags/#enable-accelerated-video-decode
 Enable Vulkan rendering in chrome://flags/#enable-vulkan
 close Chrome, start it with google-chrome --use-gl&#x3D;desktop --enable-features&#x3D;VaapiVideoDecoder You can edit your launcher settings to always include those parameters
  
Now check chrome://gpu/ again. If everything went right, you should see a lot of green there now. Video decode should now use a lot less of your CPU. YouTube will typically server you VP9 or AV1 video for which only the very latest hardware has hardware support. If you rely on hardware video decode either because you are on an old machine or you want to maximize battery life, the h264ify extension would force the use of H.264 streams. However this does not appear to work anymore.

                <p>Since I can&#x27;t just use git push with a username and password for github anymore, I had to learn to use a token today. I found using the token and URL on the command line extremely inconvenient, so I piped some commands to make the URL with the token automatically. This assumes you store your token at /root/token, so I&#x27;m also curious to hear if there are any security implications handling it this way, thanks. 
 I named the script github-push and aliased it, just so the shell can find it.
 #!/bin/bash git push $(git remote -v | awk &#x27;NR&#x3D;&#x3D;2{print$2}&#x27; | sed s/github/$(sudo cat /root/token)@github/)

                <p>I recently decided to try Linux again after many on and off attempts over the last 15+ years. Every time I used Linux, there would ALWAYS be something that would go wrong, usually hardware driver related that led to endless googling, then I just gave up as I don&#x27;t have the time nor am I in that particular line of work.
 Anyway, I&#x27;m lucky I bought a Dell XPS 9370 several years ago. I installed Zorin OS and low and behold, brand new laptop (operates much cooler, and the coil whine seems to have disappeared funnily enough).
 Thankfully, everything works out the box (except the fingerprint sensor, I can&#x27;t get that to work, if anyone can point me in the right direction that would be great, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker).
 So after installing Zorin on an encrypted partition over my old windows hd (complete wipe), I have a fully functional Linux OS that pretty much works (finally after many years!!).
 I accidently stumbled upon LTT&#x27;s YouTube video in which he talks about Steam, I thought am I hearing this right?? After downloading and installing Steam, I am able to load up AAA titles on my LINUX OS!!??!!!!. I cannot believe my eyes. When did this happen? My research indicates its using a modified version of Wine (designated Proton).
 I haven&#x27;t tested it yet on my new Dell XPS 9790 (RTX 2060 MaxQ). Hopefully Zorin (Ubuntu base LTS 20.04) is compatible with this gpu, as I want to wipe W10 from my new machine and install Linux exclusively with a W10 vm.
 A big congratulations to the Linux community for achieving major milestones without any help from Microsoft.
 ​
 Edit: I&#x27;m getting downvoted by some scrotums for simply congratulating and thanking the Linux community for outputting some amazing accomplishments. Madness!

                <p>My PC is fast enough to run the newest games but unwanted Windows processes with random names slow it to a crawl for no reason. If Linux lacks these problems AND can let me continue to work on my personal indie game project using game maker I will convert in a heartbeat.

                <p>When it comes to partitioning I&#x27;m no expert. I&#x27;ve looked up a few posts on how to do this but most either mention gparted (Mint seems to come with gnome-disks instead), or they assume you&#x27;d rather just reinstall linux entirely.
 What would be the best way to backup my linux partition, remove my windows partition, then expand mint to the whole drive, with minimal reinstalling and fixing afterwards?

                <p>On linux i always try to use de eg xfce, lxde,lxqt etc and not prefer much kde ,gnome and other high ram of usage de (desktop environment).
 To my surprise the xorg that i&#x27;d been using for a long time for Desktop user actually have a security issue. 
 My question :
 1) if i still want to use Xwindows Xorg is there a way to increase it security or it is advisable to use wayland ?
 2) What is the status of Wayland for desktop user to use it as daily driver. Does it usable and stable to use it as daily driver?
 3) how to use wayland on xfce,lxqt or lxde desktop environment. Could not find a guide for it.

                <p>I am trying to update my WSL 1 to WSL 2. I have already downloaded the WSL 2 kernel update. I went into the powershell and already changed the version default to 2. However when I type &quot;WSL --list --verbose&quot;, it still only shows me WSL 1 and nothing else. I&#x27;m not sure what information would be relevant to helping solve this problem so just ask away.

                <p>A thread in a related subreddit got me remembering a time when I talked to an anti-fraud employee at a big company about how they flag suspicious activity. I was informed that using Linux to access the website for transactions was a red flag, but a minor one, and only one of many that could be raised (so that alone might not have gotten someone shut down/out, but it was seen as a negative).
 Has anyone experienced similar scrutiny, or even been outright accused of, or targeted for, their use of Linux?

                <p>My ultimate aim is to be untethered from Microsoft, Google, Amazon &amp; Apple.
 This is my plan- 
 1) Building a Linux based desktop and a NAS. 
 2) Get off Google search. (Use DuckDuckGo maybe?. Not sure)
 2) Ditch the smart phone and use an old fashioned flip phone
 3) Get off Amazon Prime.
 Any good primers on how to build a stable and robust Linux PC?

                <p>Hello everyone, I decided to share my last project here in hope it is useful and helps some of the Linux users (except me of course). This project is dedicated to the command-line lovers that has lots of documents to handle.
 The reason I started developing this program is because of the fact I&#x27;m a command-line fan, plus I also have a fairly minimal system with no file manager, I needed a program that helps to find the desired document path and to open it using my favorite application. So I decided to create this program which in the end turned out to have these 2 features that are mentioned above and a lot more. Some of the features are :
  
Counting the existing documents and files with the passed string sequence in their names
 Listing the existing documents and files with the passed string sequence in their names
 Displaying details and info on the documents with the passed string sequence in their names
 Opening the founded document or file with the passed string sequence in it&#x27;s name using your favorite application 
  
And of course a lot more, like alphabetical sorting, reversing the results and outputting a colorful results...
 I really hope that it&#x27;s useful for some of the folks out there in the Linux community :)

                <p>What sticks out to you as just being interesting and cool in that geeky sort of way? :)
 For me, installing Gentoo from scratch and seeing it evolve into a usable system was fun and rewarding. Also, creating a makeshift NAS with a spare hard drive and raspberry pi was fun to mess around with.
 Virtual machines and containers are also something that looks fun to me, after watching a few videos about them. 
 So tell me, what do you get a kick out of when it comes to Linux and computers?

                <p>We’ve already discussed how creating web components is easier than you think, but there’s another aspect of the specification that we haven’t discussed yet and it’s a way to customize (nay, supercharge) a built-in element. It’s similar to …

                <p>This issue was already addressed 6 (!!) years ago and one project member labeled it as &quot;Won&#x27;t Fix&quot; because it worked as expected on his machine... He said that we should instead try to play with our input settings. Too bad they have no effect on the scroll speed difference between Chromium and e.g. Firefox.
 This unwanted behavior has been confirmed and discussed by so many people throughout the years (see the Chromium issue, issues from Electron apps, issues from Brave browser, reviews for the many extensions trying to solve the problem).
 I have tried the Linux Scroll Speed Fix extension but it disables the smooth scrolling and has some issues (e.g. PDFs, iframes, smooth scrolling through css is laggy). Also, it obviously has no effect on Electron apps.
 I think this issue is a deal breaker considering it effects so many apps - not only the browser. It makes the Linux ecosystem less attractive, especially if you get recommended to &quot;play with the input settings&quot; (this has nothing to do with playing). So many people are asking for a simple and user-friendly solution.
 In my opinion Chromium should provide an interface to set the scroll speed (for Electron) and a user-friendly setting in the browser where you can set the scroll speed. What do you think about it and how can we draw more attention to this issue?

                <p>When i search google i only can find something like ram usage different but hard to find real data of security test on this 3 os.
 I would to see the os eg linux distro ubuntu security test result, windows 10 and Apple when apply the same security stress test on them.
 Eg of test Fresh install of ubuntu, ubuntu with latest update and enable gufw, windows fresh install and update to latest security update, apple etc.
 Hope anyone could share with me the data.

                <p>Hi guys 👋 
 Long time Linux user here that went to MacOS full time back in 2011. I have recently decided to come back to Linux full time on my machines and ditch the Apple ecosystem altogether.
 Let me just say Linux on the desktop has polished up so much since I’ve been away. It’s amazing. I practically have an alternative app or an equivalent app for all of my work flows. The only exception is firewall.
 On MacOS I lived by an app called little snitch which would let you block connections to and from your machine on a per application basis. It was great because I could allow safari access to the internet, but block things like the notes app, or Microsoft word.
 Does anyone know a good alternative for Linux ? I’ve heard of opensnitch but idk if it’s still actively developed anymore and I’ve had troubles getting it installed and working properly. My end goal is to block all internet connections except for the apps and services I chose to allow.

                <p>Stumbled across this by accident, the FISH protocol. From the entry:
  
The advantage of FISH is that all it requires on the server-side is an SSH or RSH implementation, Unix shell, and a set of standard Unix utilities (like ls, cat or dd—unlike other methods of remote access to files via a remote shell, scp for example, which requires scp on the server side).
  
So really, what&#x27;s the advantage? If I have the &quot;standard Unix utilities&quot; I most likely already have OpenSSH installed, and thus the scp and sftp parts included. If I have any other SSH implementation, there probably won&#x27;t be the standard utilities installed.
 Am I missing something here as to why this procotol is actually needed?

 Appwrite Dashboard
 I&#x27;m an Appwrite maintainer and we&#x27;re happy to share that Appwrite 0.10 has just been released and adds support for one of our most requested features.
 Appwrite now comes with platform wide Realtime API that allows you to listen to any server side event. This includes events like user registration, file uploads, document updates, serverless function executions and much more!
 Here&#x27;s a sneak peak of 0.10
  
A brand new Realtime Server
 Real time support in our Web, Flutter and Android SDKs
 New user update endpoints for admins to manage users
 Authentication with Magic URLs
 Even Faster Cloud Function executions
 We&#x27;ve terminated some bugs
 Not to mention, we&#x27;re one step closer to becoming a complete Firebase Alternative
  
If you haven&#x27;t heard already, Appwrite is an open-source end-to-end BaaS that helps you build your Web, Flutter and Android apps much faster with a focus on simplicity, developer experience, privacy and security that you can self-host with a single Docker command.
 We&#x27;d love to get your feedback as we move on to v1.0 of Appwrite in the coming weeks. Community feedback has been one of the major driving forces for where the project is today.
 You can checkout our Github repo at: https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite

                <p>Dear Linux community.
 in the last few weeks I have been developing an application that allows you to map macro keys (&quot;G-Keys&quot;) to a different key, key combination or macro, since they were basically useless on my G910 keyboard.
 It is still WiP, but I have finished the first version ready for testing. 
 So if anyone running Debian / Ubuntu (support for other distributions will come) has a Logitech G910 keyboard and is willing to give it a try and give me some feedback, feel free to do so ;).
 The project is published under GPL v3 on GitHub:

                <p>I&#x27;ve been using Arch for a while as my daily driver and only OS. Same install over the last few hardware configs, worked pretty great. The only issue is that I accumulated a lot of packages over time, doing stuff, testing etc., and starting from a clean slate seemed easier than hunting down packages I don&#x27;t use. I&#x27;m also switching jobs, and the new job will require some Ubuntu and Windows skills - I haven&#x27;t used Ubuntu for years, and in a long time I only used Windows on company laptop for Office, Teams and WSL. Yesterday&#x27;s freetype2 update breaking Steam Runtime gave me the perfect excuse to try something new.
 So I decided to set up dual boot on my desktop PC, something I haven&#x27;t done in a decade, with Pop!_OS 21.4 and Windows 11 insider preview (to get used to it, as I guess most compan…</p>

                <p>So basically on device such as an iPad or phones in general sense when two multiple tabs containing audio are opened only one chooses to play at a time where as it is not same for laptop or PC is there a specific reason why are they limited by software wise. I also have another question on how multiple tabs can play audio simultaneously on PC.

                <p>Free Desktop is the runtime underneath all flatpaks that you can get from Flathub.org It also functions as the base for the GNOME and KDE runtime so over time, improvements made in the Free Desktop Platform will reverberate through the entire Flatpak ecosystem.
 Major improvements:
  
RISC-V support
 Reintroduce gstreamer-vaapi as extension
 SDL 2.0.16 (Vastly improved Wayland support for games)
  
Other than that, it seems like a pretty standard release.
 I&#x27;ve personally been responsible for adding TeX Gyre fonts, which should improve text-compatibility. As a drop-in replacement for Helvetica (amongst others) this should improve the rendering of websites and emails who don&#x27;t properly define font-families. There is still some other work in the pipeline to improve font-compatibility (waves fist in anger at Verdana) but this should help those who sometimes notice rather basic Text rendering in for example Firefox.

                <p>Nathan Hardy shares when things “clicked”:
Reflecting back on this time, I think there are a few key concepts that were vital to things finally all making sense and fitting together. These were:
• The Box Model (e.g. box-sizing, height, width, margin, padding)
• Layout

                <p>Not to versed on Rsync but curious if this scenario is something it&#x27;s capable of...
 I have an internal hard drive I store media and backups on. I want this sync&#x27;d in real time to a samba share which Plex uses for it&#x27;s media. Effectively I&#x27;d like to just dump a ripped CD onto the local disk and for Rsync to see something changed so copy that to the samba share. Unless Linux (using Pop Os distro) has something built in capable of doing that automagically.

                <p>Look I&#x27;ve been using computers for as long as I can remember, and I&#x27;ve never felt so... Powerful using my pc before. 
 I used everything from windows XP and above (probably earlier versions too but I was too little to remember). Used macOS since Lion. And while using my computer then was pretty great now I finally found what I felt was lacking on other operating systems... I have no idea what it is, but I found it.
 It can be as simple as being able to change my desktop environment, window manager, the color of my terminal... as far as having my computer fully accessible through SSH and streaming videos to my iPad. I feel like learning how to use a terminal, and with it Linux as the backbone has given me so much more knowledge about how my computer works than Windows or macOS ever did, and…</p>

                <p>I ended up finding a Reddit post of this topic from 10 years ago, and I was kinda surprised at that time there were quite a few still in their teens (probably changed a lot since but still interesting to me). I assume most of those users still use Linux today, but how old are you guys mostly now?
 EDIT: To start, I can say that I am 17 and I just fully started using Linux on my PC

                <p>So I decided to install Endevour OS to try out Arch [I kind of like it, super snappy but prefer Debian], and well I decided to install it with Plasma, XFCE and Gnome. Well I really do not like the look of Gnome 40 at all, it just looks plain and there is nothing to it. Like I really like the look of gnome 3 and 2. So I think if Ubuntu swaps to Gnome 40 and I don&#x27;t like it I will probably revert to Unity 7 (and 10 when it comes out).

                <p>I just wanted to share that if you are upset about what&#x27;s happening on Reddit, or even just don&#x27;t like the centralized closed-source nature of the platform that you can find Linux content on Mastodon.
 This particular Mastodon instance has a character limit of 56k and is generally focused on S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math)
 https://qoto.org/tags/linux
 Here are some FOSS accounts:
 https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux
 https://fosstodon.org/@tenacity
 https://hostux.social/@fsf
 https://mastodon.cloud/@kodi
 https://mastodon.cloud/@boilingsteam
 https://floss.social/@omgubuntu
 https://floss.social/@gnome
 https://fosstodon.org/@pine64
 Edit: Also noteworthy, Mastodon has become a non-profit last month in Germany (gGmbH non-profit limited liability company)

                <p>I think this is good advice from Silvestar Bistrović:
An enabling selector is what I call a selector that does a job without disabling the particular rule.
The classic example is applying margin to everything, only to have to remove …

 Hello!
 This is ThemeChanger, an application for Linux that I wrote. I decided to present it publicly as I recently added a feature that makes this app stand out among its peers: Kvantum theme changing support. You can now change your GTK and Kvantum themes from the same app with ease. This app has also other various features, like GTK CSS editing with instantaneous preview in the app. This app works well for me, a user of a tiling WM, but the app is definitely not fully done; there are various features that I would like to add.
 This is my first kinda serious open-source undertaking, and I hope this will work out well. Feel free to share your opinions!

                <p>I found a way on xubuntu (probably other distros as well) to watch youtube without lagging (unless your system is like 20 years old).
 From my experience, the main reason youtube lags and struggles to play even 480p video on my 12 year old laptop is not the video itself but the website.
 So I found a player that also supports youtube videos to be streamed on and it actually doesnt even utilize 70% of my cpu/igpu. Its called SMPlayer and can be installed through snap! Or you can click this link: https://www.smplayer.info/
 Obviously there are other players like this but I found this working very good so im suggesting it to you..
 Im sure most of you already knew this but Im making this post just in case anyone needs it because ive seen many people ask.

                <p>When you download and install a distro, it runs on a wide range of hardware. Do you gain anything by building your own kernel specific to your computer?
 An obvious example would be Intel vs AMD. Is there extra baggage being carried around or inefficiencies because the kernel is built to run on both?
 Or is Linux (and Windows) smarter than I give them credit for?

                <p>A bonafide CSS trick if there ever was one! @ShadowShahriar created a CodePen demo that uses pseudo-elements to place commas between list items that are displayed inline, and the result is a natural-looking complete sentence with proper punctuation.

We&#x27;re at yet another reddit blackout ran by moderators, this time because of Covid Misinformation on reddit. This is obviously a big problem and the above from Linus states what r/linux moderators feel about on Covid. There is an issue to address with reddit, though, as these blackouts are not a way to work with admins. Other reddit moderators don&#x27;t seem to want to change how they enable the poor quality job the admins are doing. These blackouts come up here and there, but mods go right back to normal after the admins take th…</p>

                <p>I&#x27;ll be mainly doing basic stuff like web browsing, e-mails, newsgroups, downloads, listening to audio, watching videos, simple SSH2 server, etc. I currently run updated Debian Jessie v8&#x27;s KDE which is fine but it doesn&#x27;t get updates for years so it&#x27;s time to move on for a clean/new Linux installation. Will getting Bullseye v11 be OK?

                <p>Like the title says I have a Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5, and have been tinkering with Linux off of live USBs and want to get an installation on the machine. I&#x27;ve used Ubuntu on and off for the last 10 years and moved back to Windows when I got this laptop. Now that I know Ubuntu will work well on this machine I&#x27;m looking at dual booting it.
 It&#x27;s a 256GB solid state drive, and currently most of it&#x27;s internal storage is used by Windows. I&#x27;m gonna be backing it up to an external hard drive tonight I&#x27;m thinking, and am curious about a good setup for partitions.
 Would it be possible to have each operating system as its own partition, with storage that is shared between the two on a third partition? If not, what would be your recommended partition setup?

                <p>Yes, that&#x27;s PCI NOT PCIe.
 I have a vintage Pentium III system that I use for older games and software and I&#x27;m looking for suggestions for well supported graphics cards. I&#x27;ve tried running a Radeon 9200, 9250 SE and Rage 128, but those cards all use the old radeon driver and performance is far, far worse in Linux than it is in Windows. 
 I&#x27;m looking for suggestions for cards that are well supported in Linux with good 2D and 3D acceleration (for a system this old). Compatibility with Windows 9x would be a plus as well.

                <p>Hi, guys.
 I got a fake PS3 controller.
 I try to use it in bluetooth connection as wiki said, but it doesn&#x27;t work...
 I try a lot of methods on the internet, no one worked ...
 So I try to read the code of sixaxis ...
 I found that maybe the hid name of fake controller is the problem, and I make a dirty fix.
 It works for my fake controller! It could work in bluetooth mode!
 Patch is here : https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/fake-ps3.patch?h&#x3D;bluez-plugins-fix
 With this patch &quot;Authorize service&quot; will ask!
 Install it and do as wiki said, maybe will work for your fake PS3 controller.
 If you have a fake PS3 controller like me, have a try!

                <p>Looking for serious answers only. Please.
 I was a windows fan. Used it for years. A few months back, my SSD crashed. Windows on HDD was too painful for me, so I switched to ubuntu then pop. 
 ​
 Except for boot time, Linux on hdd can match windows on ssd. I am talking about app load time, switching in between, multitasking and all. 
 ​
 How? And why hasn&#x27;t windows copied it yet? 
 p.s. Package manager is a god send. Period. Just too good.

                <p>I was just thinking about this, is there anything actually stopping somebody from just flashing a linux OS/kernel directly onto a motherboards firmware besides maybe like space? Has anybody tried to do this?
 Not really much different then just running linux in an embedded environment right? Could Linux theoretically then start up a bootloader and run another Linux OS? With the bottom Linux being responsible for all the UEFI stuff and the Linux running ontop of that being responsible for all the regular OS stuff?
 Honestly it probably wouldn&#x27;t even be that bad of a thing to run on a regular desktop directly from the firmware (in a user experience kind of way), I&#x27;d guess you could still use your disk for storage and /home and stuff, just the kernel and probably the initramfs would be flashed to your UEFI.

                <p>What are some highly anticipated things coming to linux soon that you can look forward to? This doesnt have to be within 1 year, but within like 5 years aswell. The ones I know about are wayland, pipewire and more proton support, but what other systems will be big upgrades to linux world?

                <p>I may get flamed for this but I have searched for hours and it&#x27;s driving bloody insane. There was a recent post, like the last week, about a wm/or desktop that looked liked a retro/classic 90&#x27;s *nix interface but was modern. I was wanting to go back to try it but I can&#x27;t find the post anywhere now. I&#x27;ve looked here and osdev. 
 Again, sorry for the post and thanks for your patience.

                <p>Basically, this is what happens:
  
Plug flash-drive into Linux computer.
 Put files on it, eject it, and unplug.
 Plug flash-drive into Windows laptop.
 Open the drive and see the files.
 Click on a file (get errors, won&#x27;t open, blank files, etc.)
 File disappears.
  
What the hell is happening? I feel like Windows and Linux might store files differently so maybe that&#x27;s the problem, but I&#x27;m not sure. What can I do to fix this? I refuse to email large zip files or individual files back and forth forever.
 Edit: Having previously formatted on Windows, formatting to FAT32 on Linux seems to have done the trick. Thanks for everyone’s help!

                <p>With Linux turning 30 and having read the discussion between Linus and Andrew Tanenbaum, I wonder if Linux is still a monolithic kernel or has it evolved to something more along the lines of a micro kernel. I ask this as in recent years lots of stuff has moved out of the kernel and into userland. Which is one of the hallmarks of a microkernel design. Or did I misunderstand something here.

 I have worked on this for past few months . exatorrent is BitTorrent Client written in Go. It can be run locally or be hosted in Remote Server with good resources to use that Server as SeedBox. It is Single Completely Statically Linked Binary with Zero External Dependencies .
 exatorrent is simple yet feature-rich . It is lightweight and light on resources. It comes with Beautiful Responsive Web Client written in Svelte and Typescript , but thanks to documented WebSocket API of exatorrent , you can also write your own client if you want to.
 exatorrent can operate in Optional Multi-User Mode administrated by admin user/s but it can successfully be used by Single-User as well. Torrented Files are stored in local disk of device where it&#x27;s run, which are then retrievable or streamable via HTTP.
 I hope you like it . It&#x27;s Open Source .

                <p>My dumbass just did shift&#x3D;del on all files on the wrong 5TB usb drive. And after hitting myself on the head 20 times I found the tool ext4magic.
 This tool can recover all deleted files that are deleted on a ext4 filesystem. I started with photorec, but found that ext4magic seems to be much faster. I did not had the option in photorec to search only in empty space. I guess this is where ext4magic does its magic because it only lookes for files that are deleted using the filesystems journal.
 So far 114GB has been recoverd. I am sooo relieved! 😀

                <p>Every once in a while, I am installing a package through apt install and notice that a lot of the dependencies are icon themes.
 For example, recently I was installing OpenJDK and saw this:
 The following additional packages will be installed: adwaita-icon-theme fonts-dejavu-extra gtk-update-icon-cache hicolor-icon-theme humanity-icon-theme 
 Why does it need all of that, if my server doesn&#x27;t even have a display, and I only access it through SSH? What is the reason for having icon themes, fonts and other UI elements?

                <p>Modern consoles that play videos need to rely on some form of an OS. For a company such as Sony or Nintendo to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; by writing a new OS from scratch every time a new console is being developed seems to be a waste of resources. I&#x27;m not mentioning mikrosoft since they have Windows to use as a base for Xbox.
 By using something like Debian, Arch, RHEL, game companies can save time by not having to write a new OS all over again. The only issue I can see with this approach is that any modified GPL licensed code would have to be re-released under the same license and it seems that big companies are not fond of the GPL for that reason (to keep any changes to the original code private).
 Anywho, these vast array of distributions and frameworks nowadays make it silly for Sony or Nintendo to start from scratch every time they want to make a new console.
  
Note: This thread is getting so many replies. Uh, thanks. But WOW, this is interesting.

                <p>So I have been looking for replacing my current windows machine with Linux. The problem is I am very dependent on my Logitech G502 mouse in which I put a lot of macros into it. So I want to make sure that I wont get problem when i change to Linux (my current target is uBuntu, but if you have any better suggestion, I can consider too). Here is my requirement:
 - DPI control: i dont care
 - Setting up all the extra buttons BASED on active window: a must
 - RGB control: i dont care
 I have stumble upon libratbag/piper: GTK application to configure gaming devices (github.com) , that said to be an alternative, can someone give me some enlightments? thx!

                <p>Hi,
 It has been a nightmare for me to have a dedicated IP on Linux. Any service that provides an actual GUI with workign dedicated ip?
 My experience with GhostVPN was horrendous, they brag about having about having a GUI for linux. It&#x27;s basically a lame cli full of errors and nowhere on their site did they say that their dedicated IP does not on linux.
 It does not, incredible.

                <p>Evening All,
 I released a new version of rehex (a cross-platform hex editor) today - mostly bugfixes and usability improvements, I hope it is of interest to people here.
 Any questions or feedback here or on GitHub is welcome :)

                <p>Just a fun shortcut for those who might not know. This appends the final argument of the previous command to the current command and re-runs the previous command if the current command succeeded. For example
 $ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/a mount: /mnt/a: mount point does not exist $ sudo mkdir !$&amp;&amp;!! 
 the final line runs the command sudo mkdir /mnt/a &amp;&amp; sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/a. Another example
 $ cd /does/not/exist bash: cd: /does/not/exist: No ssuch file or directory $ mkdir -p !$&amp;&amp;!! $ pwd /does/not/exist 
 How does it work? Shell substitution!
  
!$: insert the final argument of the previous command
 &amp;&amp;: run another command if the previous one succeeded
 !!: insert the previous command into this command line
  
I know there are a bunch of other shell substitution stuff, but I generally find those less worth memorizing than this and just look them up when I need them.

                <p>Hi everyone,
 If you regularly check out r/linux posts, I think you&#x27;d know that I posted a post about an Artix-based GNU/Linux uses LFS/BLFS to build. I received some comments that help me improve the distribution itself.
 So I have released the next version after a month of hard work. Hope you&#x27;ll check it out here: https://hanhlinux.github.io. I&#x27;ve tested packages depend on Xorg and use it to do my daily jobs. It works really well.
 I hope that all of you can leave a comment here explain what you want me to do with the system. I really appreciate it.
 Thanks for reading! Also, happy Linux 30th anniversary.

                <p>Whenever I use software, unless it&#x27;s open source I don&#x27;t really feel &quot;safe&quot;. I&#x27;m kind of paranoid, I always belive they are snooping around my system or doing shady things, so I try to avoid proprietary software as much as possible (and apart from games, nearly all software in my system is open-source).
 For some reason tho, I don&#x27;t get that feeling with Steam. I have peace of mind with it, even tho it is prorpietary software that could potentially be snooping around my system, and I have no proof to prove or deny that, but for some reason I feel like it&#x27;s different with it.
 Does this happen to you? Why might it be? Maybe because of Valve&#x27;s attitude towards Linux? Maybe because they are not in the advertising industry?

                <p>Good day,
 a couple of years ago I posted here my tiny tool to display HDD/SSD list, with prettier output than &quot;lsscsi&quot; has. The output is similar to Solaris &quot;hd&quot; command but with a couple of extra SMART fields and colors.
 Today I&#x27;ve released shd 0.1 (requires smartmontools &gt; 7.0):
 - works much faster, no longer required to parse smartctl output, as it has finally got native JSON
 - fully rewritten in Rust, statically linked, no more Python &amp; mods required - put anywhere and enjoy
 - higher default temperature thresholds for NVMe drives
 - other small improvements

                <p>Thirty years ago I just entered college and had my first encountering with Linux four years later. Ever since then, Linux has become part of my computer journey throughout these years. My first desktop computer is a preconfigured Linux system in early 2000’s. Feel quite enjoyable with and grateful for Linux! Happy birthday Linux 1991-2021!

                <p>I am currently using MacBook Air (Intel), is it good enough to learn hardcore linux or should I get a or build a new PC for playing with linux. 
 Or just stick with EC2 instances or virtual box instances ? 
 I am not very good at using linux tho, I know the minimal stuff required for handling web development projects and handling servers in EC2.

                <p>Flathub https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.kde.haruna
 Git repo https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/haruna
 Source https://download.kde.org/stable/haruna/haruna-0.7.0.tar.xz
 This is the first release as part on KDE.
 New in 0.7.0:
  
Added custom commands. They can be used to run mpv commands, like setting properties.
 Added option to toggle the opening of last played file on start up.
 Added mouse scroll seeking when mouse is over the seek bar.
 Added action to exit the fullscreen.
 Made playback settings page more consistent with the other settings pages.
 Fixed playlist staying open when mouse moves to another screen while the app is in fullscreen mode.
 Fixed not loading audio files from same folder when opening an audio file.
  
Doesn&#x27;t look like much but the custom commands is pretty big. You can use them to control parts of mpv (set properties and run commands) not exposed by Haruna. The custom commands can be run at startup or you can trigger then with custom shortcuts, they apply when first saved.

                <p>I used to use a samsung computer with 32-bit intel pentium. I wanted to run some 64-bit applications so I decided to watch some youtube videos which said to run some random commands in cmd (I was using windows 10 at the time, I realise now how stupid that was). I borked my computer and installed a 64-bit intel pentium and then started my Linux journey. Does anybody still use 32-bit computers for Linux?
 PS - sorry for my post being so long-winded, but It wouldn&#x27;t let me post because it was too short

                <p>As the title states, next week a bunch of top tech CEOs are meeting Pres. Joe Biden 
  
 “The meeting will include Tim Cook and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, with executives from Google, Amazon, IBM, Southern Co., and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co also invited to attend.
  
 Am I wrong in that almost the entirety of the Internet runs on Linux nowadays? Sure it’s big providers like AWS, Azure, etc and a couple CDNs like Akamai but they still almost all rely on Linux.
  
 Why is there no FOSS/Linux rep? At least from the FSF or Linus himself or something. It just blows my mind.
  
 Next you will tell me there is a meeting about fast food restaurant beef quality and invite Wendy’s, White Castle, Burger King but NOT McDonald’s…. You know the biggest player.
  
 Is it because FOSS is decentralized for the most part? Still should be some kind of rep. 
 I would post a link to the article but I’m not sure if links are allowed here.

                <p>Hello,
 I&#x27;ll be working on new settings including adding automod replies for Fansly, PocketStars and Many Vids. Please comment below if there are any major ones I should add. 
 I&#x27;m also looking into expanding the MOD team because it&#x27;s a little much for me RN. 
 Thanks,

                <p>For gaming purposes (my friend group playing games that are pretty annoying on Linux), I&#x27;ve been on Windows for about the last year.
 I was wondering if any major software advances have happened in that area since then. Gaming or otherwise.
 When I last left, steam gaming was pretty good (lots of native applications), and I was happy to hear it.
 Have any other major video games that are non-Steam become native or gained support? Blizzard, Riot come to mind pretty immediately. I remember Valorant was a major concern due to the kernel-level anti-cheat the implemented.
 Pretty much the only thing keeping me from being on Linux permanently was a select few, but extremely popular video games being janky at best.
 I&#x27;m also interested in any major advancements in the normal software side of things. Adobe and such. Any big application projects in this realm for daily life or any that gained official support?

 I&#x27;ve finally finished up the last details of installing and customizing Manjaro 21.1 w/ KDE Plasma DE to my liking, and it&#x27;s just gorgeous. I&#x27;ve never seen such a beautiful, flexible desktop environment sitting on top of a distro that, so far, has met every demand I&#x27;ve had for it.
 If you&#x27;d like the same setup, the details are listed in the Neofetch screenshot above about what themes, fonts, and etc I use.
 I think it&#x27;s just gorgeous. I&#x27;m not boasting, just admiring and wanted to share.

                <p>I have been working on Ubuntu OS for about 6 years now and I am pretty happy with it. 
 Recently I wanted to revive a very old laptop so that my technically challenged mother could use it for basic web browsing or movies so I put zorin os lite because of its interface. It&#x27;s really brought back an old pentium laptop from my school days that my father was going to dump in the trash plus my mom is able to use it easily so I am very happy with that.
 I really like some of the User interface in Zorin lite so I then looked at Zorin OS 16 and it seems even better. So now I am considering whether I should jump from Ubuntu to Zorin or not. Being a software developer, the vast availability of repositories and applications available to Ubuntu compared to Zorin is the only reason I haven&#x27;t made that switch
 I was hoping to get insight from people whether they would switch from Ubuntu to Zorin and if they wouldn&#x27;t, why not? If you have some other OS you want to suggest, feel free to add those as well

 All Functions supported by the script: Main menu
 I distrohopped a lot and i found myself doing stuff over and over again so i went ahead and created scripts for the basic problems laptops user face in their installs. I use an Asus Rog so the scripts works perfectly for it. It works on other laptops too except the asusctl part.
 This script is very useful for laptop users who have to setup lots of things after installing gnu/linux. Asus users can use the asusctl option for automated install of asusctl which gives them full control over fans,rgb and graphic card switching.
 Asusctl does alot more stuff too. U can find more about it here: asusctl
 It also has an option for installing pulseeffects presets automatically which i found very tiring to do.
 Currently the script supports Pacman,Zypper,Apt and Dnf.
 ​
 I hope this helps someone .

                <p>Ya know the ones where its like &quot;linux users connecting to wifi&quot; and its those h4ckErmAn scenes from movies.
 If anyone wanting to try out linux is reading this, mostly everything can be done using GUI. We use the terminal a lot cuz its more convenient.
 And for connecting to wifi you just go to settings or the top or bottom bar and click ON.

 Disclaimer: This script is made to work with my other scripts at https://github.com/sayan01/scripts and is like a part of the ecosystem. For example the accent color detection is done by &#x27;domcol&#x27; and &#x27;hexcolortoner&#x27;. The clock on the wallpaper is set by &#x27;bgclock&#x27; and the lockscreen works using &#x27;lock&#x27; which uses betterlockscreen (modified). The wallpaper is placed in .config/wall and a symlink named &#x27;wall&#x27; is created there pointing to it, which is used by bgclock. You also need the xresources patch in your dwm for the accent colors to work. If you wish to give it a try make sure to clone the entire repo and make the scripts accessible in your $PATH.
 You can also tweak the amount of difference the accent color has from the most dominant color of the image (delta)
 WM: dwm (xresources and restart patches)
 Lockscreen: Betterlockscreen
 Notification Manager: dunst
 Wallpaper Clock: bgclock

                <p>I&#x27;ve moved to linux as my daily driver and the only backlash is the complexity of settin up audio routing. I used VoiceMeeter Potato with Windows and it was so simple and just worked but haven&#x27;t found anything similar for Linux.
 Yes I know JACK has some stuff but because of how Pop!_OS is built I&#x27;m pretty much stuck with PulseAudio so it&#x27;s no use. The learning curve of using sinks and routing audio sources where i want is extremely steep and frustrating when there is no single Mixer-like GUI for handing audio that i&#x27;m aware of.
 Any GUI based app for creating PulseAudio sinks and routing them with ease? And if there isn&#x27;t an app like that - why isn&#x27;t there?

 This is how I started my GNU/Linux journey in 2003. Back then it was impossible to download a full distro because of my slow internet connection. 
 I had to buy SuSE Linux in the box with CDs and books inside (€89.90 in 2003 - not that cheap at the time). 
 Looking back, that distro feels quite primitive while it was considered among the best and user friendly! 
 A few months later (perhaps early 2004), I bought the book &quot;RH Linux &amp; Fedora Unleashed&quot; which included a DVD with the full Fedora Core (first release ever). This was far superior compared to SuSE 8.2
 I was quite a geeky kid and by my ealy teens I was able to write code in many languages, including an attempt to code in Z80 assembly on my Amstrad CPC 6128 around mid/late &#x27;80s. 
 Over the years, and with the domination of Windows, my passion for computing deteriorated. Even though I would say that &quot;I loved windows 95/98,&quot; I may have been disappointed by the lack of fascinating technologies from anyone other than Wintel.
 Linux (re)opened a whole world for me. Not least because of its free/libre nature but also about the transparency of everything. Code transparency is translated into user/developer choice from the shallowest to the deepest level of any technology - don&#x27;t forget that all developers are users too. 
 I have been using GNU/Linux (various distros) exclusively at home and in my professional setting, where the choice is exclusively mine, for the last 15 years. I have to use windows for the companies that I work for and even there, I have the choice to work on my personal computers on some projects. 
 A big, HUGE THANK YOU to all the people who have made this wonderful computing world a reality for all the geeky kids (or gen-Xer in my case) like us!

                <p>As PowerShell 7 is OS agnostic is anyone of you moved from Bash to PowerShell at Linux systems?
 I&#x27;m familiar with Windows environment and PowerShell object-oriented scripting. Learning Bash and do things on text is hard for me. 
 I&#x27;m wonder if it is common to install PowerShell at Linux machines?

                <p>Hi all, what is best source to watch for this certification?
 I love Udemy and CBT nuggets, so all suggestions are welcome. Also if someone can suggest a good book for this it will be great. I already have some but I would like to see more opinions

                <p>Hey everyone, i wanted to preface this post by saying that i&#x27;m not making this post to hate on Linux, i loved the OS, i was actually quite disappointed that i had to switch back to Windows, i just wanted to share my experience, and i&#x27;m waiting eagerly for the day when i&#x27;ll be able to switch to Linux as my main OS.
 Context :
 I switched to Linux in February of this year after my Windows PC got infected by some ransomware and ultimately started getting fed-up for the lack of privacy and care microsoft has for you in Win10
 I mostly used Pop!_Os and used Manjaro for a week or so.
 Yesterday i decided to switch back to Windows
 What i liked about Linux :
 Amazing installers : For both of the Distros i installed, the Installers were amazing, all of them give you so much control and make it so …</p>

                <p>I have been using Linux for the last 5 years as my daily driver on my desktop machine.
 I am so exhausted with all the bugs and issues that never ever go away. It seems like I am always trying to fix or resolve something on Linux just to get basic functionality.
 I used Linux Mint for 4 years, but after an annoying bug where my window snapping would have an off by 1 error, I moved to Kubuntu Plasma.
 Both of these distros would not reliably wake the monitor. Suspending, logging out, switching users, waking from suspend/monitor off have been nothing but issues for me....the entire time I have been on linux.
 At first I used an Nvidia card, and everyone at KDE was like &quot;Use AMD, its so much better&quot;....so I tried AMD. I am running an RX580 video card, which is as mainstream AMD as you could get....still tonnes of issues. It freezes when I switch users periodically. I just tried to wake my computer and the monitor was black......and I have suspend and power off monitor disabled (wtf?).
 It seems like for every bug that is fixed in KDE Plasma, a new one is created, and I really don&#x27;t look forward or have hope for any new version.
 I honestly have come to the conclusion that it is just not worth it. My hobby is not my OS, and as someone who just wants to live a stress free life and get things done, I just don&#x27;t think Linux is for me. I am quite disappointed.

                <p>I have been an avid linux user since I was 6 years old and my father stole my xp key on the old gateway pc I was allowed to use without internet. Over the years I became an enthusiast, learning and using Linux wherever I could and sharing how useful it can be with friends. Today I got an interview with an MSP who just got a new client that is purely based on Ubuntu and since my Linux experience is fairly extensive they gave me an offer on the spot! So exciting.

                <p>I just got an HP Envy x360 15z-ee100. I wiped Windows and installed Manjaro on it but the screen rotation doesn&#x27;t work and there&#x27;s no on-screen keyboard, fingerprint sensor also doesn&#x27;t work but I&#x27;m not concerned with it. WiFi didn&#x27;t work at first. I had to USB tether from my phone to get the internet and then install rtw89 driver to get it working. 
 Also the stylus doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as it did on Windows. I know most of these stuff aren&#x27;t deal breakers but it pains me to see such poor support for convertibles.

                <p>The linux community back then was much smaller and there were much less coders to contribute not to mention not many cared about the idea of FOSS. In addition internet speed was slow so downloading software, and uploading source code and contributing must have been a lot more difficult than now days. I clearly remember testing it out that printers and WIFI was a major issue and many things were missing drivers.
 To the hardcore ones, do you think linux back then was as viable replacement for Windows/Mac as is today or things have advanced so much to the better now?
 Thanks for holding ground for the rest of us who went Windows/Mac :D

                <p>I see many people praising GTK apps&#x27; looks and thight integration with many DEs. It then seems logical to want to learn to use it. The problem is, the official docs are great... For C, and other languages&#x27; bindings are not as good and sometimes outdated.
 So this is my question, how does one learn to use GTK ? Looking at source code is great, but isn&#x27;t there another way ?

                <p>There’s still no support for too many important web components even integral stuff. Even nginx doesn’t officially support it yet? 
 What are the alternatives. I know there’s alma but that seems to be even worse if your using certain cloud providers.
 Is there any other decent rhel fork at this point?l that is truly production ready?

                <p>I recently switched to an Arch-based distro and honestly it&#x27;s the best UX I&#x27;ve come across of all distros I&#x27;ve used before. 
  
The AUR is the best thing since sliced bread. With an AUR package manger (e.g. I use yay) you can install almost any popular app out there with a single command. Installing stuff like Joplin, Intellij IDE&#x27;s, Spotify, discord, filezilla, and tonnes of others is such a pleasure compared to the install procedures on other distros. If you&#x27;re lucky you get a .deb you can install on a Debian-based distro, but usually you have to extract tarballs and set up .desktop files yourself, which is such a hassle. Not to mention manually managing updates.
 The Arch wiki is my savior. Pretty much every issue I&#x27;ve come across since installing has had a dedicated Arch wiki page with well-written instructions on how to fix the problem. I haven&#x27;t seen similar user-friendly and in-depth wikis for other distros. 
  
Sure things get a little hacky at times, especially if you&#x27;re installing from the command line. But for Linux beginners an Arch-derivative with a GUI installer serves up a dream situation.

 All Functions supported by the script: Main menu
 I distrohopped a lot and i found myself doing stuff over and over again so i went ahead and created scripts for the basic problems laptops user face in their installs. I use an Asus Rog so the scripts works perfectly for it. It works on other laptops too except the asusctl part.
 This script is very useful for laptop users who have to setup lots of things after installing gnu/linux. Asus users can use the asusctl option for automated install of asusctl which gives them full control over fans,rgb and graphic card switching. 
 Asusctl does alot more stuff too. U can find more about it here: asusctl
 It also has an option for installing pulseeffects presets automatically which i found very tiring to do.
 Currently the script supports Pacman,Zypper,Apt and Dnf.
 ​
 Please contact me if you find any issue or have any suggestions for me.
 ​
 I hope this helps someone .

                <p>I&#x27;ve had android for all my life, but in my focus on privacy I&#x27;m working to make the switch to IOS. With that switch comes losing some IOS functionality from my understanding, but I wanted to know if there were any apps that people who have Linux and IOS side by side that you guys can&#x27;t live without.

                <p>Hello!!
 I just started my linux journey recently, when I booted GalliumOS onto my asus chromebook. I&#x27;ve been learning how to navigate things using the terminal with commands like cd, ls, and pwd. And creating/ deleting things using touch, mkdir, and rm. Even though it&#x27;s pretty simple so far it has me feeling really good about linux and I&#x27;m excited at all the possibilities of what I can learn next. If you guys have any recommendations on what I could try next or any tips that would be greatly appreciated. If not, I appreciate you getting this far, I am super excited to join this community!

 Look like I am the only schmuck noticing this and the whole world going merry-go-around...whoever using it #linux on desktop/laptop ....irks ..
 Damnit! on Linux Desktop/Laptop , it is pretty evident that two things constantly malfunctioning. 
 One, gpg-agent died after certain time, so to bring it back , kill it .Meh .. 
 Second, Notification-daemon stops working after a certain point in time. Same treatment...kill the damn thing.

                <p>Nowadays, is possible to build a PC that use only open-source device drivers from kernel (even without closed firmwares)? There is some list with supported devices that I can use as reference? I know that BIOS maybe is difficult to achieve this, but maybe the rest of the system is possible?

                <p>Seriously Linux is in a fantastic state these days, it really is. Im on Linux Mint, I switched over from Windows 10 about 2 months ago and everything has been mostly fine. I did this switch previously maybe two years ago now but ended up back on Windows because I needed 2 screens for RDP for work. Now Remminas latest flatpak has multi monitor support, so I have that now. Im not a guy who only uses a basic browser and a text editor either im a software developer who plays games. I have some pretty complex needs (or at least I think I do). Just off the top of my head:

I need RDP to get into my work machine.
 I have 2 screens of varying resolutions, I need both of these to work with RDP.
 I use multiple audio output devices, one goes to an external DAC, the other to the headset.

                <p>people in the BSD community like to insult linux saying its bloated, userland is a mess, very chaotic, etc.
 From what I have seen, the &#x27;actual&#x27; barebone linux kernel is only 10 megs. The rest is just drivers and architectures and filesystems. Is that bloated?

                <p>Hey All:
 I do a lot of distro hopping, and every time I reinstall a new distribution I have to reinstall and re-setup x11vnc so I can use my phone to control my computer when I am away. I got tired to doing it manual every time so I wrote this quick little script that automates the process for me. Thought I would just share it here in case anyone else is in the same boat.
 This script thus far has only been tested on Linux Mint running Cinnamon, but I would imagine it would work on any Ubuntu based distribution. I did test trying to run x11vnc on OpenSUSE, but I could never get it to work properly.
 Feel free to edit, update, or even make your own script off this. There are probably already a thousand different scripts like this in existence, but was it one of the characters in Startcraft II that said &quot;This is my C-14 Impaler gauss rifle! There are many like it, but this one is mine!&quot;
 https://github.com/BeholdenCypress/BashScripts/blob/main/x11vnc_install.sh
 P.S. Was not sure which flair to use, so sorry if it is the wrong one. Let me know which one I should&#x27;ve used and I will change it.

                <p>It started about a year ago when I was porting a REST service to C++ for fun. I was comparing different frameworks and by far the easiest to set up and get going was Crow. Problem is it was abandoned since 2017. 
 A year and a ton of hard work from myself and many other people, and not only did we fix so many problems that it had, but added many more features. The latest being blueprints similar to python flask, and a better JSON implementation (although it&#x27;s still far from perfect).
 I tried to make the whole platform more user friendly by adding in code documentation, guides, and a landing page to advertise the framework.
 I also did some simple benchmarks (mostly based on criteria set by TechEmpowered) and the results (I had to extrapolate them because I was running the tests locally on my personal machine) showed great potential, to the level where Crow would saturate a 10gbps connection at 70% performance.
 I&#x27;m making this post to let people know that if they&#x27;re looking to run their own web service or upgrade an existing one that Crow might be a viable framework for them. I apologize if this isn&#x27;t the right place or I misunderstood the rules in any way.

                <p>This version adding REALLY interesting new feature - it is now possible process multiple files in various formats and merge/mesh them into single output file formated by template. Take a look on example here https://mmalcek.github.io/bafi/examples/#multiple-input-files
 So you can combine data from various sources and generate single output view :)

                <p>I&#x27;m seeing a sad pattern lately. Software for Linux is being distributed for Linux as containers such as flatpaks, appimages, etc. or as straight binaries but the documentation that come with these formats in very limited or non-existent. I&#x27;ve also not seen any applications distributed this way contain man pages.
 That&#x27;s not to say that I&#x27;m against containerized applications. I&#x27;m, not. I&#x27;m a great proponent of appimages in particular. I think that could be a great way to bring back awesome software that is no longer compatible with current Linux distros because the dependencies have been dropped. However, I find that it&#x27;s assumed that documentation will be on a website somewhere instead of on the system with the software. I think there could/should be a middle ground where you have your containerized or binary-only packages but also full documentation with it in the form of man pages or some other easy to use format.

                <p>Weylus is incredible. It allows you to have your PC in your iPad, and you can do basically everything.
 The applications are infinite. Here&#x27;s the github page: https://github.com/H-M-H/Weylus

                <p>Lately I&#x27;ve been thinking about the security of my desktop OS. I&#x27;ve come across projects such as https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hardened-kernel and I&#x27;m wondering why distros don&#x27;t just harden their kernels by default?

                <p>When I wanted to install Manjaro, I could not go into my BIOS firmware. I thought my grub was overriding my firmware so I decided to delete my /boot/grub/grub.cfg configuration and update my grub conf. I thought I could go to my BIOS settings now, but I ended up locking up my computer. I could not boot into my OS nor could I go to my BIOS settings. I later found out my motherboard was not working, thus I messed up my install

                <p>Brian Kardell shares a bit about the progress of bringing &quot;Tabs&quot; to HTML. We kinda think we know what they are, but you have to be really specific when dealing with specs and defining them. It&#x27;s tricky.

 First, a little background about myself. I was a software engineer for 5 years where I got most of my experience in using Linux. I then went to dental school and have been a practicing dentist ever since. This “report” will be more focusing on my dental practice and how I started it up.

It really warms my heart. But, I wonder, why don&#x27;t they all do that? In fact, why aren&#x27;t &quot;national distros&quot;?</a></h3>

                <p>You&#x27;d think a Public Domain system that all citizens can participate in building and improving, and which can simultaneously be used as a learning opportunity to increase digitalization and IT literacy, would be a slam-dunk, from the point of view of the State. Why buy an OS from some foreign megacorp, and be at the whim of their profit-motivated choices, when you can tailor your own system to your own needs, have full localization of language, standards, norms... and invite the citizens to participate themselves in giving feedback, cotributing to it, building it up, etc. They can organize armies, collect taxes, run ports, enforce laws, etc, on their own. Some of them have National Churches, National Healthcare Systems, National Education Systems. Truly enormous and outstanding organizations. I can&#x27;t imagine why they wouldn&#x27;t make and run their own publicly-supported, free-at-the-point-of-purchase, open-source OS? 
 Hell, France had even come up with their own &quot;internet&quot; standard at one point, the Minitel. Where&#x27;d that kind of effort go?

                <p>Hi, i&#x27;m so confused right now, i was doing research for days, but i couldn&#x27;t find a single reference that explains how the core implementation of widget toolkits and how they draw and make widgets like buttons, scrolling, ...?
 Is every widget is an X window that gets manipulated? if true how an X window will be rounded corners and shadow behind the window? or it&#x27;s just a bunch of graphics?
 how does scrolling is implemented for widget toolkits, i feel that scrolling is hard to be implemented in a 2D graphics API, i think that openGL will deal with this problem? but how openGL gets into the context like this?
 Thanks a lot for reading, if there are any existing resources that i am not aware of, i would really like to read.

                <p>Just found out many distro not enable the firewall on fresh installation.
 Try enable the ufw or gufw for added security on your linux box.
 Other simple added security we can enable are the &quot;full disk encryption&quot; or partially /home folder encryption.
 Most distro come with firewall preinstall but not enable by default.

                <p>My country will be switching from DVB-T to DVB-T2 over the course of next year.Since my television (a 2016 Sony Bravia, not smart nor HEVC compatible) will not support DVB-T2, I have been looking for a decoder which either ran Linux or could possibly be hacked to support e.g. Debian.
 Since I see that many decoders also enable extending the TV internet connection capabilities, turning it into a smart TV, I would really be glad to run something which is not Android, so as not to worry about all the possible google and manufacturers&#x27; spyware - while at the same time reaping the benefits of a smart TV.

                <p>I really had no idea where else to post this, would appreciate it if I could be guided to a more appropriate sub for asking this question, in case this is inappropriate.
 I understand the hardware implementations of HEVC, as I am guessing it&#x27;s pretty clear that if a chip on a device were to include hardware codecs, it would be pretty easy to keep a count of them (since they would be produced in bulk). But how exactly do you get a royalty for software implementations? Technically, given the resources should I not be able to create a software implementation at home?
 According to the wiki, software implementations no longer need to pay the royalty as of 2017, but prior to that how exactly was this even enforced? 
 Is it even possible for someone to implement at least a basic variant of standard codecs at home?

                <p>I used to LOVE Windows but lately I almost only ever use Mint Linux and when I DO boot into Windows 10 I always get issues with enough Windows updates issues and conflicts to the point where I just want to delete that partition and use a Virtual Machine whenever I actually really need Windows.
 I have a 4th gen i5 processor, GTX970 graphics card, 16gb RAM, 500gb SSD, 1TB HDD, and I feel it&#x27;s a decently powerful system. I use Windows mostly for when I feel like producing music using Reaper (which I hear can run in WINE, not sure about plugin support), or playing the odd video game here and there.
 **Main question:**
 What are the drawbacks of these methods? In my mind, I assume I can keep my Linux processes running using the onboard GPU provided by the processor chip while giving my Windows VM access to my NVIDIA card so I can run... video games, photoshop, and other Windows software
 Is it a hassle to set up and maintain? I don&#x27;t mind fiddling with settings a bit, as long as it isn&#x27;t ungodly hard to make compatible. I wonder if I would have a lot of issues with my PC crashing or the VM not being able to access my graphics card consistently.
 Any thoughts/comments are welcome :D I&#x27;ve only done light research, but it sounds like a good idea

                <p>Hi all, I&#x27;m taking a class on Linux/Unix and also Python and the laptop I currently own is an ASUS i3 with 8GB of RAM and am being told it won&#x27;t do it. So, in that case, with a budget of $450 out the door, any recommendations? I can give my old laptop to the Mrs since hers is so slow and frustrating for her.

                <p>Hi everyone,
 I just brought a photon zero resin printer (which, i think, only accept .photon files) and the slicer software made by Anycubic is only compatible with windows and mac. Do any of you know an alternative that would work on linux ?
 I already tried Chitubox but it didn&#x27;t really work (also, if possible, i would prefer an open source software).

                <p>I understand that you can learn a lot by installing everything form the ground up, but isn&#x27;t ist a bit to much to ask from somebody who has no idea about linux?
 And... i really dont understand why so few recommend debian. I think it&#x27;s a good start, especially with the gui install and a simple desktop. it also leaves them with a fairly clean install so they can then build up from there.
 What do you recommend new users?

                <p>I posted this on r/linuxquestions too, but this post isn&#x27;t about using GNU/Linux but the world around it so here I go:
  
 Let me preface by saying this is not a satirical post. I am genuinely curious.
  
 Currently I am about 50% ready to make my big leap to GNU/Linux as my main OS (still planning stuff). The question in the title popped up in my head today though from my paranoia side. Who actually funds the development GNU/Linux, FOSS, etc. I am NOT insinuating anything with my question about individual developers or projects intentions. Just genuinely curious.
  
 From doing various searches you can find the Linux foundation with members requiring to pay big fees to be higher tier members and such. With other smaller projects (like Pi-hole) it&#x27;s Patreons that support it along with indi…</p>

                <p>Hello there.Does anyone know (as convenient as it gets would be great, i&#x27;m pretty much a noob on beginner user level) a solution to play audio through two sets of speaker, each on some usb/bluetooth amp? Aka &quot;an alternative to Voicemeeter Banana&quot;? With a GUI please!
 When having my pc in this room, i just plug one amp via usb, the other via bluetooth and can set both with a latency (in ms) in Voicemeeter, and give it out via &quot;voicemeter input&quot;, a virtual audio device i select in audio properties. Now both amps play.
 Can i do that in linux? I have this setup in my sleeping room (just 2 pair of speakers, each on a little 10€-bluetoothamp from eby) and can use it with my pc. but when i carry it in my living room to work next week, i just stay with my raspi as a little media calculator on my tv. Which is great, but sadly i just can run one pair of speakers at the time. Which is sure fine but both together just sound neat and round, just sweet.

                <p>I just founded on Internet and think it cool to share it.
  
Link: http://oldlinux.org/
  
OldLinux is the website created by Jiong Zhao - Chinese Engineer Staff. It collected all the material of all Ancient Linux including doc, bin, source code, some Chinese PDF File about Linux, image and more.
 You can find the early stage of some Linux major distros like Slackware, Debian, etc... You can even find the early stage of system library like gcc and a lot. Also it have the VMWare image (I)don&#x27;t know why it not have the free alternative VM image)
 If you like to view the history of Linux you can view this page.

                <p>Has anyone installed an ARM Linux on any of the ARM laptops (Surface Pro X, HP Elite Folio, Macbook Air, etc)?
 I have worked with Ubuntu ARM on Jetson boards but I believe we are moving away from X86 and in the next 5 years most of the laptops in the market will be using ARM cpus and as someone who is using only Linux for both my work and personal laptops, I want to know how easy it is to install Linux on them.

                <p>I&#x27;ve been looking for reference books about Linux to learn in a better way about the operating system (I prefer books over tutorials, YouTube videos or blogs in most cases). Some folks told me about O&#x27;Reilly and for dummies series books and I found an editorial called Packt publishing with some good titles, but I would like to know if you, redditors, have some of these books and which titles do you recommend. Thanks for your answers!

                <p>Why does one distro hop? What does one distro offer that another doesn’t? Aside from a package manager… essentially not much. So what drives one to install and reinstall over and over? I think it may be a combination of boredom coupled with a short lived sense of accomplishment. Lately when I get the itch to hop I just channel that feeling into learning C. The instant gratification isn’t there but at the end of the day once the feeling has passed, I get a better sense of peace. Any thoughts?

                <p>For me, I have been using Linux on and off for years, but the straw that finally broke the camels back this year was learning that my computer would not be able to run Windows 11. Sure, my laptop is 8 going on 9 years old now, but she is still a powerhouse.
 I finally decided that Microsoft was not going to get to decide when my laptop has had enough and needs to be replaced. With Linux installed, I will probably keep this laptop going another 5 or more years depending on the performance 5 years from now.
 How about you? What made you decide to move away from Windows, or MacOS, or whatever you used before Linux (if you used anything before Linux)

                <p>Hello, I&#x27;ve been working on trying to better understand Linux at a lower level.
 My current exercise is migrating some of my Windows services to Linux and I&#x27;m trying to do so in a best practices manner.
 ​
 I have some confusion about the partitioning recommendations in the CIS Benchmark CIS_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_8_Benchmark_v1_0_01
 ​
 Creating a seperate filesystem/logical volume for the following directories has a classification of 2 (For use in environments where security is paramount, and may have some side effects), however setting flags on those directories such as the nodev option is classified with a 1 (baseline security requirement for all environments that should have little to no impact). However I assume that setting the nodev, noexec, etc options on a folder would require that it&#x27;s a seperate filesystem or logical volume so it makes separating those a requirement?
 ​
 If I go that route I end up with 10 separate volumes with seems somewhat excessive.
 ​
 /boot
 /boot/efi
 /
 /home
 /tmp
 /var
 /var/log
 /var/log/audit
 /var/tmp
 SWAP
 ​
 How practical would having that many seperate volumes be in a production non federal information system environment? I could see it causing some support headaches for JR sysadmins?
 ​
 A specific example would be the following CIS Control
 1.1.7 Ensure separate partition exists for /var/tmp (Scored) - CAT 2 (for high security)
 1.1.8 Ensure nodev option set on /var/tmp partition (Scored) - CAT 1 (Baseline reccomendation)
 ​
 Thank you in advance!

                <p>I&#x27;ve been on mint for a few years now. I really have no problems with it. It just has a few of the little quirks about it that bug me...some of them are the same reasons I left windows (biggest among them are the forced updates.).
 So, since I&#x27;m thinking about building a new machine, I thought I would also upgrade my version of Linux.
 I&#x27;m not looking for something super locked down and difficult to use. I&#x27;d like some user friendliness, but maybe a little more control than what Mint offers.

                <p>I&#x27;ve been using Firefox for over a decade now, and although I do agree with some posts here about issues with the new UI. I believe we are going about it the wrong way.
  
 Let me preface by comparing to another recent example that I have encountered. With Apple and their new CSAM scanning aka backdoor no matter how much we kick or scream they won&#x27;t back down because they are a gigantic corporation that is also beholden to the government. In Firefoxs case, yes they are a business, a not for profit one at that. However, whatever Mozilla does to Firefox can be worked around by some tinkering or getting an alt. For example I use IceCat now because I don&#x27;t like the telemetry and some bloat in FF like Sync and Pocket.
  
 HOWEVER, if Firefox would actually stop development like so many people a…</p>

                <p>I&#x27;ve been using Ubuntu on the system I&#x27;m working on, the main reason being that I want to have an OS that remains stable for the time I&#x27;m using it for it&#x27;s purpose, long term support, no shenanigans.
 I&#x27;m interested in other systems such as Arch but I need a reliable workstation - am I wrong in assuming that a rolling release cycle might infere with that goal? Are my worries justified?
 I mostly do scientific programming, on a cluster, but locally I&#x27;d need LaTeX up and running, some stuff like Inkscape, Sublime text, maybe run some simple code here and there.
 Edit: what I mean by instability can pretty much be summed up with &quot;software components won&#x27;t work anymore after upgrading&quot;

                <p>I need to get some desktop systems up and running whose main purpose are to run a bunch of virtual machines, so I need all the spare ram I can get. I&#x27;ve been unhappy with the ram usage of Mate and XFCE, and they offer a bunch of stuff we don&#x27;t necessarily need anyway, so I&#x27;ve been looking for a window manager that&#x27;s lighter.
 However I&#x27;ve encountered a major problem. It seems that like 95% of these projects are dead and haven&#x27;t seen any updates in 5-15 years, and the other 5% that are alive act like they tripped and fell out of 1998. They don&#x27;t support HiDPI monitors, they don&#x27;t support asian/middle eastern languages or emoji, they have no ability to graphically configure any options or preferences, half of them don&#x27;t even come with a taskbar, etc. (And that&#x27;s not even touching on how they look ugly as sin).
 Is there any option out there that was designed this millennia? Something that can be used on modern hardware by normal office workers in an international setting?
 edit: Also I forgot to mention that this needs to be a floating/stacking window manager, ones that are tiling-only won&#x27;t work for our use case.

                <p>I have created a 40TB volume and the used space is 286G. There is no data on the disk and no hidden files. I have researched and found that this is the metadata (data about the future data) on the volume. Is this size able to be changed? Does XFS recommend this size? What are the options on this size if any?

                <p>Nobody cares whether I&#x27;m using kdialog/zenity/custom dialog generators, they care about the result. And making the trained &quot;ok&quot; click instead be a cancel click is just !#$#ing wrong. I don&#x27;t see a way to fix it short of a fork or just switching to zenity, am I missing something?

                <p>A friend asked me to save their old laptop so their kid could use it. But they&#x27;re really fed up with mobile app games and such, they want a platform that supports edultainment, looks attractive, and gives them plenty of parental control.
 The laptop is a relatively old HP pavilion. It overheats on Windows 10. It performs very well with AntiX with LXQt, but then the Sugar packages don&#x27;t seem to work.
 The country&#x27;s language is Spanish.

                <p>You can try vaapi acceleration on latest Firefox too on linux.
 On Firefox stable go to about:config and set :
 gfx.x11-egl.force-enabled to true media.ffmpeg.vaapi-drm-display.enabled to true media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled to true
 media.ffvpx.enabled to false
 Then install firefox add &quot;h264ify&quot; for youtube. Then play some video and watch the cpu usage got drop or still high.
 And add addon &quot;h264ify-embed-fix&quot; for hardware acceleration other than youtube website eg vimeo.
 Firefox getting better and better with their latest release. Cant wait for &quot;WebGpu&quot; to be implement on firefox stable.
 Anyway once everything work you can remove h264yify addon. After that monitor again the cpu usage when playing youtube video whether it drop or increase with h264yify disable.
 Tested on Firefox 90.0

 Feren OS Customized by Me
 ​
 I don&#x27;t know, I just want to talk about it for a second. I found out that it was developed by only one person, because it certainly doesn&#x27;t look or feel like it. Now some of that may come down to the fact that Ubuntu is rock solid, and KDE Plasma&#x27;s just gorgeous, but it&#x27;s all in how those ingredients are properly baked.
 Someone on another forum asked to be sold on the OS, and I tried. I told them that I tried Linux Mint, but the Cinnamon DE was lacking, missing a few features I needed (like a lock screen that didn&#x27;t show my wallpaper) and couldn&#x27;t create a workaround for, while MATE and XCFE weren&#x27;t able to give me the environment I wanted, which needs to be flexible. I like to tweak my settings, and there weren&#x27;t many ways to do that with those DEs.

                <p>Hi, I&#x27;m a comp engineering student and we got an assignment to write about something OS related. 
 I thought I would write about how processes and threads work in linux by giving an overview of the underlying datastructures and algorithms.
 Someone know/have any tips about where I can find info on this?

                <p>Alright, lets face it. Linux does not have 100% feature parity to Windows when it comes to applications. There are just some applications for Windows that A) do not have a Linux counterpart or B) has a Linux counterpart, but is sorely lacking.
 So I just wanted to start this discussion. What are some of the Windows applications you use in Linux using Wine? For me the two biggest ones are 7-Zip and Foxit Reader. I use 7Zip on Windows, and the archive manager in Linux just does not compare. Same with Foxit. The Linux version of Foxit just does not hold a candle to the Windows version.
 The best part I think it, both these applications work flawlessly using Wine.

                <p>I see more and more distros no longer support 32-bit architectures. The same applies to software. I&#x27;ve been trying to apply AntiX and Tinycore Linux to some old machines. Even installing GRUB was a challenge and took several tries. (Windows XP looks so much uglier than I remember.) 
 There seems to be a lot of older machines that would be given a second life by lightweight Linux distros. But how can we keep them relevant and functional in a world where ten packages in a given dependency tree get updated every other day?

Don&#x27;t do this unless you can afford break your installation. I had a minimal amount of packages and user no data, but that might not be the case for you.
 I recommend logging out of the graphical session and using a tty instead (Ctrl+Alt+3). The GUI is going to be broken in all sorts of fashions before all problems are resolved. And you&#x27;ll probably be ejected from your session mid-update, so don&#x27;t even bother.
  
Change /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d entries from bionic to focal.
  
Open each URL you&#x27;re about to change in a browser to verify that the dist folder has a focal folder. If it doesn&#x27;t, then don&#x27;t change it to focal, let it bionic.

                <p>VA-API
 Va-api installation depending on the GPU generation you have, so I recommend you to follow this excellent Arch linux guide, (It&#x27;s not just for arch linux, applies to ubuntu as well)
 https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hardware_video_acceleration
 Once you download the package, verify it using vainfo or vdpauinfo depending upon your GPU. Then you are good to go.
 Browser
 You can use any chromium based browser like Brave and Vivaldi, but for this guide I will be using chrome-stable. I will be also using x11 for this guide, so few steps might vary for wayland.
 Version
 Unfortunately chrome 92 update broke hardware acceleration on linux, so we will be using Chrome 91. Google might &quot;fix&quot; it in future, but no can guarantee it.
 Installation
 91.0.4472.164-1 is the last version where Hard…</p>
