I'm making this distribution for people who want to boot Linux with their files on almost any computer. Not just that but making Gaming is also a big focus on this distro. It's Tails/Debian based so software isn't a problem. The preinstalled software list is so far made up by Steam, Wine, NVIDIA Control Panel (in the NVIDIA version), and GIMP.\n There are 2 versions with 2 variations possible - Standard - Extra Pre-installed software Edition\n  \nNormal Variation\n NVIDIA Variation\n  \nIf there is anything that I could add or change I would be happy of you wrote it it the comments.\n I do not expect this post to blow up so to the few that see this, Hello and thank you for listening to my idea! :)\n    submitted by    /u/zromitsman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Not long ago, as some of you may be aware, Adobe purchased Allegorithmic. Which meant that they now had Substance 3D, an overall excellent and top of the class tool for 3D work and CGI. This suite was, to my knowledge, always native for Linux with no issues.\n Will this change as Adobe has fully rebranded Substance Suite into its messy arsenal of some of the best software in each field? From their FAQ on their official website, Linux builds are not available through Adobe's subscription, only available on Steam's perpetual version.\n  \nLinux builds of the Substance apps aren’t available via Individual Adobe Substance 3D subscriptions. At this point the Linux version is only available on Steam for Substance Painter & Substance Designer. For Teams & Enterprise plans on Adobe.com, please contact [sales@substance3d.com](mailto:sales@substance3d.com).\n  \nI won't be naive, they won't sell any more perpetual licenses from now on. Does this signify the end of practical, efficient and stable 3D texture development on Linux? I love Blender and I use it for work, but there is no practical, affordable and high quality alternative to Substance 3D. Blender just doesn't cut it.\n It seems like a pointless move to remove Linux support, but oh well.\n    submitted by    /u/spaliusreal  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, for white text on blue background, I used 37 for Bg and 44 for Fg.\n These seem to be reversed from what I thought they should be, according to this ANSI color code table.
