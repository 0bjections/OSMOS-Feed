I just use my computer for games, homework, browsing, programming, modeling, and video playing.\n I got more involved with Linux from its way of being customizable.

Anyway, not affiliated to Google but I recommend Linux users to plug any old gaming controller to your Linux PC, make sure to install NVIDIA drivers and have hardware acceleration in Chrome and try Stadia pro for free, games are cheaper than other platforms even.

Intentionally breaking things to make one task or another easier or cooler because I did it. That's what I thought it was to be a \"power user.\"\n Linux changed that entire idea for me, I've been using Ubuntu on and off for server applications for a couple years but that was just copy pasting into Putty and not actually learning it so that doesn't count in my mind, I've been learning and daily driving Linux for about a year now and it's completely changed my view of being a power user, I don't need to break anything anymore (intentionally) to make something work for me, it either just works or can made to work so easily. Linux is the definition of complete computing freedom, to make anything work exactly how you need to have it work.\n Some say that's a lot of work, which it is. But for a \"power user\" it's a wet dream come true. I love Linux, every problem I come across gives me more insight into how it actually works on a deeper level and I'm almost sad I haven't had more problems with it over the past year.\n So thank you to all the helpful people who spread your knowledge helping people like me understand and fix the issues we create that you may or may not have done before us.

It can download, patch, configure, compile and install kernel source. It also handles everything with mkinitcpio. You can name the kernel as well. It's only been tested on Arch but theres not really any reason it shouldn't work on some other systems provided you edit the directories at the top of the script if they are different and the system uses mkinitcpio. The easiest way to explain it is to list the options:\n $ kernel : Shows info about currently installed kernel and lists kernels on system and backups.\n $ kernel -i : Install the kernel version passed as an argument. Can be any version (eg 5.14.7).\n $ kernel -n : Will list the newest longterm and stable kernel and allow you‚Ä¶",

In a 2016 mailing list post (https://lwn.net/Articles/704336/) spender provides a checksum of his \"KASLR haha 17\" text file, which describes / exploits a KASLR vulnerability in the Linux kernel that he was aware of at the time. Today (in 2021) the vulnerability was found by someone else and fixed upstream: https://lists.openwall.net/linux-hardening/2021/09/24/14\n The checksum is a way to prove that the file he had back then matches the fix released today, or at least to verify a string of text mentioning the problem, while withholding any actual information about the fix. He has a habit of posting checksums in tweets and later revisiting them while saying \"grsecurity had this fix for X months/years.\" In other words, government agencies and other corporations can get the fix, but everyday users cannot.\n His whole business model is being bitter and hostile to Linux, while also benefiting from it. His company's paid-only patchset contains other security enhancements in addition to unreported security issues like this one. By hoarding vulnerabilities to his customers, he is hurting the entire Linux community. It's absolutely scummy behavior of the worst degree.\n Do you know any companies that support this guy by subscribing to grsecurity patches?\n    submitted by    /u/koiwacandy  \n [link]   [comments]",

My local machine is MacOS (yea yea, I know). I am new to vagrant and love the tech. I am also a big fan of ansible.

I'd shown him Linux on my laptop and for what he does (web browser/email/docs) I suggested, after his windows crashed again, I'd put an SSD in and try him on Zorin Linux.\n Once I'd installed it and set everything up, he came in, I showed him, he responded \"OH, it's just like Windows\".\n Suddenly I felt REALLY offended, \"It's really not\", I said, just about to launch into a detailed explanation about why it was *NOT* just like Windows. Luckily I didn't. because it just occurred to me how easy that switch was (although I put it in dark mode for him, he loved that and showed him the 6 or so different desktops he could have).\n The main advantage for him was he has quite an old printer, so old, that his Macbook laptop doesn't recognise it, of course Zorin just saw it straight away (BEFORE IT EVEN INSTALLED), ofcourse when it booted the printer was there.\n I just have mixed emotions if all we've achieved is something that's \"just like windows\". But I know it's so much more.\n I'm just wondering if others have stories of switching users over.\n    submitted by    /u/linuxpaul  \n [link]   [comments]",

So more or less ‚Äúit‚Äôs a known bug somewhere in the kernel/hardware, but instead of fixing it we‚Äôre going to make you restart because that‚Äôs easier.‚Äù\n This is like the 5th time I‚Äôve had to restart my Mac for stupid reasons like this (others are Monitors causing the display to glitch, Bluetooth headphones getting stuck as single channel headsets, and even an unexpected VPN disconnect causing DNS queries to fail), and restarts are not cheap as they disrupt my workflow. Honestly, even Windows feels more stable than MacOS imo these days.\n My company sadly is too deep into the Mac life, and I‚Äôll never get to switch to Linux, but boy I SURE do dream of it...\n Anyway, clearly this was a bit of a rage post, but I‚Äôm genuinely curious about all of your interactions with Mac as Linux users both out of curiosity and wondering if I‚Äôm in the minority here.

          "description": "Recently, the support of Qt theming with Kvantum was merged on Flathub. It's now available as org.kde.KStyle.Kvantum.\n Do keep in mind that currently, this is more of a hack and requires manual intervention like overriding permissions.\n Preparing\n We need to install Kvantum from Flathub to enable us to use Kvantum themes in Flatpak apps. Run flatpak install org.kde.KStyle.Kvantum (add --user if you want to install it as user).\n The only requirement on the host system is having Kvantum installed. The instructions on installing Kvantum are here. The Flatpak package does not include the Kvantum manager at the moment.\n How to use it\n I will take OBS Studio (com.obsproject.Studio) as an example. Since OBS Studio uses its own theme by default, any system Qt theme won't be used by default. Open OBS Studio, go to Settings > General, change the Theme to System, you should see the Breeze theme used (or Breeze dark), and lastly, close OBS Studio.\n Open Kvantum Manager, or kvantummanager in the terminal. Select the theme you desire.\n To test whether it works or not, run flatpak run --env=QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum --filesystem=xdg-config/Kvantum:ro com.obsproject.Studio, replace com.obsproject.Studio with the Qt app you are testing. The theme you chose on Kvantum should be applied to the application. Since we specified the environments in the terminal without overriding any permissions, this is only temporary.\n To permanently apply it on OBS Studio, run flatpak override --env=QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum --filesystem=xdg-config/Kvantum:ro com.obsproject.Studio (add --user if OBS Studio was installed as user). Do that on every Qt application you have installed.\n Edit: you can also override globally.\n  \nSadly, as said before, it is hacky. It's not as convenient as GTK theming. But hey, it's a huge step in the right direction.\n Happy tweaking.\n    submitted by    /u/TheEvilSkely  \n [link]   [comments]",

Reinstalled the whole OS because KDE leaves too many configs behind, screwing up my Gnome install.\n Gamed on it for about more than a month, and wanted to screw with X (non-existent), only to find out I don't even have X installed. All my games and stuff, including Rocket League, Monster Hunter World, PC Building Simulator, some Muck here and there, also some native Ark and CSGO, has been running under XWayland flawlessly out of the box, no tinkering needed whatsoever, with basically no performance issue compared to when I was using X.\n Things that I can't really measure the performance includes Telegram Desktop, Firefox and Steam, all works with no hiccup. Then I tried OBS which also worked flawlessly.\n One thing I did notice though, is significantly reduced tearing from my games and video playback.\n So far, the only problem I encountered, was when I disconnected one of my monitors (I have 2 with different resolution) to use it with my Switch. When I switched the monitor back to my PC, fonts and scaling get fucky wucky. But that has only happened once, and I switch between my Switch and PC on this monitor very frequently.\n Otherwise, for my day to day use, this is already better than X.\n EDIT: Relevant specs:\n - Ryzen 7 3800X\n - 6700XT\n    submitted by    /u/kuaiyidian  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, an early MMORPG went through an era it almost collapsed (and had to reinvent several core mechanics) to get around cheats and unintended automation.

I'm asking this boring question because soon I will be making small changes to my setup and PC and with Win 11 around the corner I was checking that out as well. While it seems really cool and all it also gave me flashbacks of Win 8 Metro UI which I despised very very much so. So I kinda started on thinking about alternatives.\n I'm primarily a gamer but I also use office software and media creation softwares everyday and also some pirated software. Now alternatives are fine and all but pirated software is a bit of a question mark? I don't even know if that's a thing on Linux.\n My guess is that my day to day usage would probably not be affected by it. But I was also wondering, if I will be facing any performance issues. Unfortunately I don't really have a PC which I can confidently say 20-30-40% performance drop wouldn't effect me, it would effect me very bad. So that's my second main concern.\n Leaving Microsoft's ecosystem and privacy/security issues are like at the bottom of the list for me if I have to be honest. I'm one of those people that don't really have sensitive information and I know what I'm doing so I never had any major security issues either.\n So yeah in short, I'm wondering what will I have to leave behind and how much of a performance hit I will take on things which I bring with me.\n Edit: Thanks everyone for very detailed responses.

          "description": "Hi there!\n New to linux but im learning lots on my journey! Im working on a new project, and im not 100 percent on the nuance of the OS yet.. was hoping to see what yall think?\n The current project is creating a safe space (edit::from viruses and malware on the main os windows) on my computer for my banking needs and what not. Something that has a zero percent chance of transfering potential malware from my main pc.. the options im currently considering are: Bootable password protected usb or virtual machine.\n Now.. i like the idea of the bootable usb because i can litterally disconect it from the pc when im not using it and correct me if im wrong but if the os is password protected/encrypted then my main os (windows) has no ability to write to the seperate harddrive while its plugged in and in use..\n The other option ive been discovering is quite popular among the linux community is via virtual machine! Im obviously hesitant on this option because im still learning about them.. but this seems easier and makes more sense to me.. that being said, i dont have a great understanding on whether or not my source os (windows) will have communication/installation privileges with the linux os on the VM because really the VM creates its own space on the same drive..\n Totally open to other ideas as well!

He became famous for bringing an era of cheap computers to every home with his ZX80 & 81 and the eponymous ZX Spectrum. He later went up markets and tried to make a business machine called the Sinclair QL , or Quantum Leap.\n What you might not know, though, is Linus first learned to program on a Sinclair QL and in fact inspired him to think of multitasking and doing things himself. \n So with the passing of this larger than life character we should give thanks to his inspiration, not only to 1000's of bedroom programmers who would kickstart the computer games industry and some are still riding high in it now, but also to the serious programmers like Linus, who, if he did not have a QL itch to scratch might never have written Linux at all. \n RIP Uncle Clive.

Sometimes it's because we feel like we should know something. More often, it's because we don't want to look stupid by asking a question. You know what, it's perfectly okay to ask stupid questions. I'll say it again, it's okay to ask stupid questions. The key to asking stupid questions is to ask them intelligently. No, that's not a contradiction in terms. Asking stupid questions intelligently does two things. First, it gives you confidence and you feel less stupid. Secondly, it prepares you for the answer.\n Question 1\n Stupid question:\n Can someone ELI5 (explain it like I'm 5) the OSI model?\n Let's break down why this stupid qu‚Ä¶",

Ensure your printer supports this mode in order to print. It also supports network printers over AppSocket/port 9100, no IPP support or anything too fancy. You need write access to the printer device file in order to print to it, so for parallel printers for example, you must be a member of group lp. Written in node.js so make sure you have node.js installed and in the path. Why did I write it? To learn how printers work. Download at https://gist.github.com/thecoder08/685297015ee6bc7cff681dddeff71783\n To try it out, save the raw file in the path and chmod +x it. It should be accessible via the print command. To use it, run the command (as root if necessary) and enter the device type, IP address/device, and file to print. It should automatically print after you enter the document name.\n Edit: you guys seem to hate it so I‚Äôm deleting it.

I've written some instructions and scripts to build LFS (Linux From Scratch), version 11.0, as simply as possible (I know, not that simple, but anyway). It's basically a super summarized version of the LFS book.\n You can check the instructions and get the scripts from my GitHub repository: https://github.com/luisgbm/lfs-scripts\n Key points:\n  \nFirst, this guide does not replace reading the whole LFS book. I highly recommend that you read it at least once. Only then you should use the automation scripts provided here.\n The whole process is run inside VirtualBox.\n You need two hard disks attached to your VM (one for the host, one for receiving the LFS build).\n Most steps will be executed via Shell scripts (there are four of them).\n Some steps need to be manually run.\n At the end, you will be able to create a separate VM and boot from it directly.\n  \nHope you enjoy it, and feel free to send me feedback.\n    submitted by    /u/bergaminix  \n [link]   [comments]",

Small footprint and highly customizable. However.\n I saw Openbox was no longer offered as a community edition on the Manjaro download page, and decided to take a look at the latest patch notes, and they are ancient.\n Hence, I started to wonder if people still use Openbox at all. Also it got me wondering if I should consider transitioning into something more modern.\n So let me know if you use Openbox. Or have used Openbox and why you switched to something else.Or if you have suggestions to what WM or DE that would be a suitable replacement, that is welcome too!\n ‚Äã\n https://preview.redd.it/djmd6t2opgn71.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a449c51e067d5cb516872577bbcd226080d34139\n    submitted by    /u/Technical_Experience  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then when Ubuntu went to Unity (what a mess), I went to Mint and Cinnamon. And there I've remained to this day.\n In the last week, I've had 3 separate conversations where someone suggested that I really \"ought to\" leave the \"beginner\" environment of Linux Mint. All 3 suggested that I should move to either Arch or Manjaro (if I didn't want to do the full install path of Arch). When I pressed for details, they all mentioned \"rolling releases\" and \"latest versions\". But, aside from a snarky \"it's a grown up's OS\", no one really gave me a reason that seems all that compelling.\n So I'm asking the brain trust, is there a compelling reason for me to distrohop? To what? And why? What would I gain from moving to Arch, or Manjaro, or Gentoo, or LFS, or whatever... aside from just learning a new way to do things.\n My machine is reasonably modern and can run whatever DE I throw at it.

I even tried to install the Windows drivers on WINE, it didn't work.\n So what's stopping the development of a compatibility layer for Windows device drivers to run on Linux exactly?\n The ability to run Windows device drivers would be a great help for Windows users transitioning to Linux without the worry of their hardware being incompatible with the OS, because lets face it, Linux's market share is so low that companies like Canon, Adobe, etc will never outright support Linux.\n    submitted by    /u/ardouronerous  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've just started to realize that the best way to show your appreciation for stuff you use, even if it's free, is to pay whatever you can. Especially now, maybe more than ever, it all helps. Even if the amounts are small, you're communicating your care and appreciation for someone who's done a good job, and is making your life easier. And when I say pay \"what you can\", be honest with yourself - how much is the thing really helping you, and what could you give without noticing too much? Or even do without something that you could really do without, and pass on the couple of bucks a month? I'm not blowing smoke. I like Calibre for ebooks, and Geary for email. Wikipedia & archive.org are essential. So I pay them all what I can, every month. If it happens that I can't anymore, well, I'll just stop & try to start again when things are better.\n    submitted by    /u/r05sC  \n [link]   [comments]",

It can be used to update... non-updatable programs too (see -u, update).\n -l, list Shows the list of apps available in the repository.\n -r [argument], remove [argument] Removes a program (requires confirmation, default is N).\n -s, sync Updates the list of available apps.\n -u, update Update AppImages using 'appimageupdate', if the update info is embedded into the AppImage itself by the developer.\n The link to the repository is this: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan\n The list of available apps is here, I've also provided some templates for you to modify the way you like (here).

In addition to this there has been a large number of contributions from our users who have been actively working with the pre-release versions to test it, make sure it works in the real world and with a large array of different applications and reporting their results. I am also delighted to note that there has been a 94% increase in the amount of documentation that we have since OpenSSL 1.1.1 and an (adjusted) increase in the ‚Äúlines of code‚Äù in our tests of 54%. There has never been a better demonstration of what an active and enthusiastic community we have than when you look at the statistics for the OpenSSL 3.0 development work.

Some if it may well be because Chrome to this day (Version 93) still disables GPU accelerated video decode by default.\n To check it for yourself, go to chrome://gpu/ - if everything there is green for you, great! You can stop reading this post.\n If you, like me, find both \"Video Decode\" and \"Rasterization\" to be \"Software only\" and want to change that, keep reading. I noticed most of the \"Problems Detected\" are more than a decade old and even stem from the fglrx driver. So just because AMD had terrible drivers in the past, Chrome still plays it safe and does not touch hardware acceleration to avoid breaking some fringe configuration!\n But MESA drivers are pretty good now, let's get rid of that blacklist:\n  \nEnable the Hardware Accelerated Video Decode flag in chrome://flags/#enable-accelerated-video-decode\n Enable Vulkan rendering in chrome://flags/#enable-vulkan\n close Chrome, start it with google-chrome --use-gl=desktop --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecoder You can edit your launcher settings to always include those parameters\n  \nNow check chrome://gpu/ again. If everything went right, you should see a lot of green there now. Video decode should now use a lot less of your CPU. YouTube will typically server you VP9 or AV1 video for which only the very latest hardware has hardware support. If you rely on hardware video decode either because you are on an old machine or you want to maximize battery life, the h264ify extension would force the use of H.264 streams.

Every time I used Linux, there would ALWAYS be something that would go wrong, usually hardware driver related that led to endless googling, then I just gave up as I don't have the time nor am I in that particular line of work.\n Anyway, I'm lucky I bought a Dell XPS 9370 several years ago. I installed Zorin OS and low and behold, brand new laptop (operates much cooler, and the coil whine seems to have disappeared funnily enough).\n Thankfully, everything works out the box (except the fingerprint sensor, I can't get that to work, if anyone can point me in the right direction that would be great, but it's not a deal breaker).\n So after installing Zorin on an encrypted partition over my old windows hd (complete wipe), I have a fully functional Linux OS that pretty much works (finally after many years!!).\n I accidently stumbled upon LTT's YouTube video in which he talks about Steam, I thought am I hearing this right?? After downloading and installing Steam, I am able to load up AAA titles on my LINUX OS!!??!!!!. I cannot believe my eyes. When did this happen? My research indicates its using a modified version of Wine (designated Proton).\n I haven't tested it yet on my new Dell XPS 9790 (RTX 2060 MaxQ). Hopefully Zorin (Ubuntu base LTS 20.04) is compatible with this gpu, as I want to wipe W10 from my new machine and install Linux exclusively with a W10 vm.\n A big congratulations to the Linux community for achieving major milestones without any help from Microsoft.\n ‚Äã\n Edit: I'm getting downvoted by some scrotums for simply congratulating and thanking the Linux community for outputting some amazing accomplishments.

So I decided to create this program which in the end turned out to have these 2 features that are mentioned above and a lot more. Some of the features are :\n  \nCounting the existing documents and files with the passed string sequence in their names\n Listing the existing documents and files with the passed string sequence in their names\n Displaying details and info on the documents with the passed string sequence in their names\n Opening the founded document or file with the passed string sequence in it's name using your favorite application \n  \nAnd of course a lot more, like alphabetical sorting, reversing the results and outputting a colorful results...\n I really hope that it's useful for some of the folks out there in the Linux community :)\n    submitted by    /u/yan_kh  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This issue was already addressed 6 (!!) years ago and one project member labeled it as \"Won't Fix\" because it worked as expected on his machine... He said that we should instead try to play with our input settings. Too bad they have no effect on the scroll speed difference between Chromium and e.g. Firefox.\n This unwanted behavior has been confirmed and discussed by so many people throughout the years (see the Chromium issue, issues from Electron apps, issues from Brave browser, reviews for the many extensions trying to solve the problem).\n I have tried the Linux Scroll Speed Fix extension but it disables the smooth scrolling and has some issues (e.g. PDFs, iframes, smooth scrolling through css is laggy). Also, it obviously has no effect on Electron apps.\n I think this issue is a deal breaker considering it effects so many apps - not only the browser. It makes the Linux ecosystem less attractive, especially if you get recommended to \"play with the input settings\" (this has nothing to do with playing). So many people are asking for a simple and user-friendly solution.\n In my opinion Chromium should provide an interface to set the scroll speed (for Electron) and a user-friendly setting in the browser where you can set the scroll speed. What do you think about it and how can we draw more attention to this issue?\n    submitted by    /u/QuickTurtle9  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have recently decided to come back to Linux full time on my machines and ditch the Apple ecosystem altogether.\n Let me just say Linux on the desktop has polished up so much since I‚Äôve been away. It‚Äôs amazing. I practically have an alternative app or an equivalent app for all of my work flows. The only exception is firewall.\n On MacOS I lived by an app called little snitch which would let you block connections to and from your machine on a per application basis. It was great because I could allow safari access to the internet, but block things like the notes app, or Microsoft word.\n Does anyone know a good alternative for Linux ? I‚Äôve heard of opensnitch but idk if it‚Äôs still actively developed anymore and I‚Äôve had troubles getting it installed and working properly. My end goal is to block all internet connections except for the apps and services I chose to allow.\n    submitted by    /u/Lechap0  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have no idea what it is, but I found it.\n It can be as simple as being able to change my desktop environment, window manager, the color of my terminal... as far as having my computer fully accessible through SSH and streaming videos to my iPad. I feel like learning how to use a terminal, and with it Linux as the backbone has given me so much more knowledge about how my computer works than Windows or macOS ever did, and‚Ä¶",

Its called SMPlayer and can be installed through snap! Or you can click this link: https://www.smplayer.info/\n Obviously there are other players like this but I found this working very good so im suggesting it to you..\n Im sure most of you already knew this but Im making this post just in case anyone needs it because ive seen many people ask.\n    submitted by    /u/Username1392  \n [link]   [comments]",
