Which meant that they now had Substance 3D, an overall excellent and top of the class tool for 3D work and CGI. This suite was, to my knowledge, always native for Linux with no issues.\n Will this change as Adobe has fully rebranded Substance Suite into its messy arsenal of some of the best software in each field? From their FAQ on their official website, Linux builds are not available through Adobe's subscription, only available on Steam's perpetual version.\n  \nLinux builds of the Substance apps aren’t available via Individual Adobe Substance 3D subscriptions. At this point the Linux version is only available on Steam for Substance Painter & Substance Designer. For Teams & Enterprise plans on Adobe.com, please contact [sales@substance3d.com](mailto:sales@substance3d.com).\n  \nI won't be naive, they won't sell any more perpetual licenses from now on. Does this signify the end of practical, efficient and stable 3D texture development on Linux? I love Blender and I use it for work, but there is no practical, affordable and high quality alternative to Substance 3D.

          "description": "Today I wondered if I could change the colors of the progress bar apt shows when installing/removing packages.\n Turns out, you can, and it's only kinda fiddly.\n Man pages have been unhelpful in this, and the only information I could find on this is from when Ubuntu 14.04 was the latest, so apt may have changed slightly since then, but I got things working how I want.\n You'll need to create a file at /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99progressbar, (permissions 644) and add the following:\n Dpkg::Progress-Fancy \"1\"; Dpkg::Progress-Fancy::Progress-Bg \"%1b[**m\"; Dpkg::Progress-Fancy::Progress-Fg \"%1b[**m\"; \n Where ** is an ANSI color code number. For example, for white text on blue background, I used 37 for Bg and 44 for Fg.\n These seem to be reversed from what I thought they should be, according to this ANSI color code table. But I'm just fumbling my way through this anyhow.\n Anybody know if there are any more options for making apt prettier?\n    submitted by    /u/TheOmegaCarrot  \n [link]   [comments]",

But this is useful when you have concrete implementations in your code and not when you are developing it :( They know a better way to be able to use a raspi from termux\n    submitted by    /u/erickGiancarlo25  \n [link]   [comments]",
