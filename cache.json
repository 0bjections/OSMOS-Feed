I got tired to doing it manual every time so I wrote this quick little script that automates the process for me. Thought I would just share it here in case anyone else is in the same boat.\n This script thus far has only been tested on Linux Mint running Cinnamon, but I would imagine it would work on any Ubuntu based distribution. I did test trying to run x11vnc on OpenSUSE, but I could never get it to work properly.\n Feel free to edit, update, or even make your own script off this. There are probably already a thousand different scripts like this in existence, but was it one of the characters in Startcraft II that said \"This is my C-14 Impaler gauss rifle! There are many like it, but this one is mine!\"\n https://github.com/BeholdenCypress/BashScripts/blob/main/x11vnc_install.sh\n P.S. Was not sure which flair to use, so sorry if it is the wrong one.

          "description": "It started about a year ago when I was porting a REST service to C++ for fun. I was comparing different frameworks and by far the easiest to set up and get going was Crow. Problem is it was abandoned since 2017. \n A year and a ton of hard work from myself and many other people, and not only did we fix so many problems that it had, but added many more features. The latest being blueprints similar to python flask, and a better JSON implementation (although it's still far from perfect).\n I tried to make the whole platform more user friendly by adding in code documentation, guides, and a landing page to advertise the framework.\n I also did some simple benchmarks (mostly based on criteria set by TechEmpowered) and the results (I had to extrapolate them because I was running the tests locally on my personal machine) showed great potential, to the level where Crow would saturate a 10gbps connection at 70% performance.\n I'm making this post to let people know that if they're looking to run their own web service or upgrade an existing one that Crow might be a viable framework for them. I apologize if this isn't the right place or I misunderstood the rules in any way.\n    submitted by    /u/the_edev  \n [link]   [comments]",

Software for Linux is being distributed for Linux as containers such as flatpaks, appimages, etc. or as straight binaries but the documentation that come with these formats in very limited or non-existent. I've also not seen any applications distributed this way contain man pages.\n That's not to say that I'm against containerized applications. I'm, not. I'm a great proponent of appimages in particular. I think that could be a great way to bring back awesome software that is no longer compatible with current Linux distros because the dependencies have been dropped. However, I find that it's assumed that documentation will be on a website somewhere instead of on the system with the software. I think there could/should be a middle ground where you have your containerized or binary-only packages but also full documentation with it in the form of man pages or some other easy to use format.\n    submitted by    /u/Capitan_Picard  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use Windows mostly for when I feel like producing music using Reaper (which I hear can run in WINE, not sure about plugin support), or playing the odd video game here and there.\n **Main question:**\n What are the drawbacks of these methods? In my mind, I assume I can keep my Linux processes running using the onboard GPU provided by the processor chip while giving my Windows VM access to my NVIDIA card so I can run... video games, photoshop, and other Windows software\n Is it a hassle to set up and maintain? I don't mind fiddling with settings a bit, as long as it isn't ungodly hard to make compatible. I wonder if I would have a lot of issues with my PC crashing or the VM not being able to access my graphics card consistently.\n Any thoughts/comments are welcome :D I've only done light research, but it sounds like a good idea\n    submitted by    /u/alienz0mbie  \n [link]   [comments]",

Aka \"an alternative to Voicemeeter Banana\"? With a GUI please!\n When having my pc in this room, i just plug one amp via usb, the other via bluetooth and can set both with a latency (in ms) in Voicemeeter, and give it out via \"voicemeter input\", a virtual audio device i select in audio properties. Now both amps play.\n Can i do that in linux? I have this setup in my sleeping room (just 2 pair of speakers, each on a little 10€-bluetoothamp from eby) and can use it with my pc. but when i carry it in my living room to work next week, i just stay with my raspi as a little media calculator on my tv.

However I assume that setting the nodev, noexec, etc options on a folder would require that it's a seperate filesystem or logical volume so it makes separating those a requirement?\n ​\n If I go that route I end up with 10 separate volumes with seems somewhat excessive.\n ​\n /boot\n /boot/efi\n /\n /home\n /tmp\n /var\n /var/log\n /var/log/audit\n /var/tmp\n SWAP\n ​\n How practical would having that many seperate volumes be in a production non federal information system environment? I could see it causing some support headaches for JR sysadmins?\n ​\n A specific example would be the following CIS Control\n 1.1.7 Ensure separate partition exists for /var/tmp (Scored) - CAT 2 (for high security)\n 1.1.8 Ensure nodev option set on /var/tmp partition (Scored) - CAT 1 (Baseline reccomendation)\n ​\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/bananna_roboto  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "With all the new 470 Nvidia drivers, Gnome 40 and so on is there a proper solution for using external monitor connected to the Nvidia-Optimus laptop where all the output ports are wired to the NV card? I've been waiting for it for so long time sitting on Windows that I'm not sure if someone came up with something brilitiant on the matter. I tried the new Solus lately (MATE, GNOME) with 470 drivers and the thing is still in the woods. The newest driver supposed to support Wayland which was supposed to be the remedy for the slow animations while using external displays but the current state still is that the external display does not work on Wayland. It's infuriating so much. Besides how the hell the nouveau drivers are able to maintain smooth UI animations on both screens (internal 144hz and external 60hz) and the proprietary drivers cannot (minus some tearing on nouveau drivers)?\n    submitted by    /u/CptCharlesVane  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also really love Linux and really do not want to go back to Windows as my daily if I can at all help it.\n So I decided to marry the best of both worlds. This is my 2012 laptop running Linux Mint 20.2 running the Windows 9x theme made by b00merang over on GitHub. It gets very close to looking like the Windows classic theme. So much so that it has actually fooled me a couple times when I was not paying attention.\n I even installed Microsoft Office for Windows 95 through Wine to complete the look. Even in 2021, its still a fairly decent word processor. I actually do use it.\n https://preview.redd.it/chwlz6xjeeg71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=350be2c28259b0ea06992d9d8965ee6bcced1fd8\n    submitted by    /u/Beh0ldenCypress  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have had a spirited discussion on why we think it is or isn't.\n I say it is the kernel that matters (outdated doesn't matter since I don't have any use changes this comment seems to agree, even with older versions, it can run GNU software, it has reached better than partiality in terms of software, can chroot, runs x11 and may not run an ARM version of every exact software but other options including open source software I have used have been found. Choice in a well supported Android device will yield an excellent Linux experience (such as unlocked bootloader, custom recovery, and root), mainline support is always being added, and many can run UBtouch, PMOS, and custom roms.\n The argument against it is that it is not a distro of GNU/Linux with a mainline vanilla kernel; it is ACK, has a lack of updates, which come in the form of patched old kernels, has proprietary software like skins or custom UI, also usually added google services and apps, not compatible with the exact ARM version of the package. The hardware and software is often locked, you cannot usually replace parts, and newer apps may need newer versions of Android.\n What do you think? (I know the PinePhone and Librem5 exist, but they are hardware downgrades to my current hardware).\n    submitted by    /u/Prygon  \n [link]   [comments]",

JACK has been around for a while, and PipeWire seems to have just shown up recently. So when you need more than ALSA maybe there's more than one game in town now.\n Curious what the advantages/disadvantages are for a pure ALSA stack, what extensions/configurations you need to make it work best, and finally if there's anything that it seems it still just can't do.\n    submitted by    /u/supersonicpotat0  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specifically, assuming you had the max 4 GB of RAM on the 32-bit version of XP, it would use only ~105 MB of that. If you put some RAM pressure on the OS, it would scale down even more to ~75 MB. Ever since Vista's release though, that number skyrocketed all the way up to ~850 MB with 4 GB of RAM with it scaling down to its lowest of ~215 MB when memory pressure is applied.\n Now, I know exactly what everyone's going to type now.

And the light will still switch on when they’re plugged in? What the fuck could be going on? \n Sorry to come off a bit on edge, but those 2 USBs have really important data on em(luckily I have most of it backed up), but it’s just starting to get infuriating. I figured maybe they could’ve gotten corrupt, so I bought 2 more to replace them and they read fine, then suddenly it’s just like disappeared. And now I’m nervous plug any USB flash drive in. What could be going on? Any advice? \n As stated, I have sensitive data that I would like to have backed up.

Surprisingly he actually had a lot of fun trying to troubleshoot and fix, and he hasn't stopped thanking me for introducing him to GNU/Linux.

So apart from coding, I sometimes watch movies, listen to spotify. So, to sum it up, I don't really use my GPU.

It seems there should be a filesystem or block device replication system that works like database replication. For example in PostgreSQL you enable transaction logging to another server and take a base backup, then to restore to any point in time you just need the base backup plus all the logs from the backup time to the point in time where you need to recover.\n Is there a block device driver or filesystem that does something similar? I'm not aware of it. I don't think DRBD goes that far.

The VGA card in particular uses a large SMD IC which might take several tries to solder right.\n  \nCPU: Intel 8088 overclocked from 4.77MHz to 8MHz\n RAM: 640KB minus the reserved segments, mostly for the VGA framebuffer. VGA is overkill for an XT/AT and wastes some precious upper memory so I will switch to CGA once I receive my HDMI conversion board (basically just an FPGA with connectors).\n Disk: Compact Flash with IDE adapter. Dual boot with MSDOS 3.3 through bootable flag. The filesystem used is Minix v1.\n  \nThe kernel is built with a TCP/IP stack, but I don't have an ISA ethernet card yet to test it.\n The userland ships with some nice utilities including a micro httpd server, an IRC client and more.\n It's obviously fairly slow and a bit of a memory hog once booted (160KB) compared to MSDOS, being written in C instead of 8086 assembly. However it's really fun to bring Linux to 40 years old PCs.\n https://github.com/jbruchon/elks\n    submitted by    /u/rahen  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I have a background in theoretical cs, but that's it). I have completed and used LFS as my primary distro for a couple of months as well, and one of my personal projects involved writing a full basic userspace implementation from scratch in C. All of these were for fun and learning.\n But as I'm going for my PhD (in math), I just realised that I would like to have a secondary source of income, as the university fundings would barely cover my living expenses in a foreign country (US). \n So I was wondering if there was any opportunities for someone like me, with no formal training in system administration or programming, or any certification (they're expensive) to get any kind of part time job?

From their FAQ on their official website, Linux builds are not available through Adobe's subscription, only available on Steam's perpetual version.\n  \nLinux builds of the Substance apps aren’t available via Individual Adobe Substance 3D subscriptions. At this point the Linux version is only available on Steam for Substance Painter & Substance Designer. For Teams & Enterprise plans on Adobe.com, please contact [sales@substance3d.com](mailto:sales@substance3d.com).\n  \nI won't be naive, they won't sell any more perpetual licenses from now on. Does this signify the end of practical, efficient and stable 3D texture development on Linux? I love Blender and I use it for work, but there is no practical, affordable and high quality alternative to Substance 3D.

For example, for white text on blue background, I used 37 for Bg and 44 for Fg.\n These seem to be reversed from what I thought they should be, according to this ANSI color code table. But I'm just fumbling my way through this anyhow.\n Anybody know if there are any more options for making apt prettier?\n    submitted by    /u/TheOmegaCarrot  \n [link]   [comments]",
