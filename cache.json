Sometimes it's because we feel like we should know something. More often, it's because we don't want to look stupid by asking a question. You know what, it's perfectly okay to ask stupid questions. I'll say it again, it's okay to ask stupid questions. The key to asking stupid questions is to ask them intelligently. No, that's not a contradiction in terms. Asking stupid questions intelligently does two things. First, it gives you confidence and you feel less stupid. Secondly, it prepares you for the answer.\n Question 1\n Stupid question:\n Can someone ELI5 (explain it like I'm 5) the OSI model?\n Let's break down why this stupid qu‚Ä¶",

Ensure your printer supports this mode in order to print. It also supports network printers over AppSocket/port 9100, no IPP support or anything too fancy. You need write access to the printer device file in order to print to it, so for parallel printers for example, you must be a member of group lp. Written in node.js so make sure you have node.js installed and in the path. Why did I write it? To learn how printers work. Download at https://gist.github.com/thecoder08/685297015ee6bc7cff681dddeff71783\n To try it out, save the raw file in the path and chmod +x it. It should be accessible via the print command. To use it, run the command (as root if necessary) and enter the device type, IP address/device, and file to print. It should automatically print after you enter the document name.\n Edit: you guys seem to hate it so I‚Äôm deleting it. It was just for fun and not intended for real use which you guys can‚Äôt seem to wrap your heads around. Also can someone tell me why node.js is bad beside it not being installed by default?

I've written some instructions and scripts to build LFS (Linux From Scratch), version 11.0, as simply as possible (I know, not that simple, but anyway). It's basically a super summarized version of the LFS book.\n You can check the instructions and get the scripts from my GitHub repository: https://github.com/luisgbm/lfs-scripts\n Key points:\n  \nFirst, this guide does not replace reading the whole LFS book. I highly recommend that you read it at least once. Only then you should use the automation scripts provided here.\n The whole process is run inside VirtualBox.\n You need two hard disks attached to your VM (one for the host, one for receiving the LFS build).\n Most steps will be executed via Shell scripts (there are four of them).\n Some steps need to be manually run.\n At the end, you will be able to create a separate VM and boot from it directly.\n  \nHope you enjoy it, and feel free to send me feedback.\n    submitted by    /u/bergaminix  \n [link]   [comments]",

Small footprint and highly customizable. However.\n I saw Openbox was no longer offered as a community edition on the Manjaro download page, and decided to take a look at the latest patch notes, and they are ancient.\n Hence, I started to wonder if people still use Openbox at all. Also it got me wondering if I should consider transitioning into something more modern.\n So let me know if you use Openbox. Or have used Openbox and why you switched to something else.Or if you have suggestions to what WM or DE that would be a suitable replacement, that is welcome too!\n ‚Äã\n https://preview.redd.it/djmd6t2opgn71.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a449c51e067d5cb516872577bbcd226080d34139\n    submitted by    /u/Technical_Experience  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been 100% on linux since 2002, when I took my Unix skill and brought it into my home on OpenSuse. In 2005 or so, I moved to Ubuntu. Then when Ubuntu went to Unity (what a mess), I went to Mint and Cinnamon. And there I've remained to this day.\n In the last week, I've had 3 separate conversations where someone suggested that I really \"ought to\" leave the \"beginner\" environment of Linux Mint. All 3 suggested that I should move to either Arch or Manjaro (if I didn't want to do the full install path of Arch). When I pressed for details, they all mentioned \"rolling releases\" and \"latest versions\". But, aside from a snarky \"it's a grown up's OS\", no one really gave me a reason that seems all that compelling.\n So I'm asking the brain trust, is there a compelling reason for me to distrohop? To what? And why? What would I gain from moving to Arch, or Manjaro, or Gentoo, or LFS, or whatever... aside from just learning a new way to do things.\n My machine is reasonably modern and can run whatever DE I throw at it.

I've just started to realize that the best way to show your appreciation for stuff you use, even if it's free, is to pay whatever you can. Especially now, maybe more than ever, it all helps. Even if the amounts are small, you're communicating your care and appreciation for someone who's done a good job, and is making your life easier. And when I say pay \"what you can\", be honest with yourself - how much is the thing really helping you, and what could you give without noticing too much? Or even do without something that you could really do without, and pass on the couple of bucks a month? I'm not blowing smoke. I like Calibre for ebooks, and Geary for email. Wikipedia & archive.org are essential. So I pay them all what I can, every month.

All the actions and the binary files are installed in /opt/bin.\n Usage\n appman [option] or appman [option] [argument]\n where option include:\n -h , help Print this message.\n -a [argument], about [argument] Show basic info on each application, link to the website and/or the source and how to update some applications.\n -c, clean Remove all unnecessary files and folders, i.e. backup files, installation scripts, and temporary folders zip or deb packages.\n -f, files Programs installed on the system.\n -i [argument], install [argument] Install a program. It can be used to update... non-updatable programs too (see -u, update).\n -l, list Shows the list of apps available in the repository.\n -r [argument], remove [argument] Removes a program (requires confirmation, default is N).\n -s, sync Updates the list of available apps.\n -u, update Update AppImages using 'appimageupdate', if the update info is embedded into the AppImage itself by the developer.\n The link to the repository is this: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan\n The list of available apps is here, I've also provided some templates for you to modify the way you like (here).

I used Ubuntu back then, thought GNOME was slow and awful, and switched to XFCE instead. \n However, as WEP went away and WPA looked like more of an effort to crack (dictionary attacks look like they took too long), I stopped using Linux and haven't really touched it since. \n Recently though, I decided to give Linux a spin after hearing news about the Steam Deck and how SteamOS is switching to Arch.

In addition to this there has been a large number of contributions from our users who have been actively working with the pre-release versions to test it, make sure it works in the real world and with a large array of different applications and reporting their results. I am also delighted to note that there has been a 94% increase in the amount of documentation that we have since OpenSSL 1.1.1 and an (adjusted) increase in the ‚Äúlines of code‚Äù in our tests of 54%. There has never been a better demonstration of what an active and enthusiastic community we have than when you look at the statistics for the OpenSSL 3.0 development work.

          "description": "Disclaimer: This enables a feature that is disabled by default, if you are experiencing render issues make sure to remember how to turn in off again!\n I have an AMD GPU that uses the amdgpu driver, if you are not using MESA drivers your experience may vary!\n Some people are experiencing shorter battery life / worse performance when browsing the Web on Linux. Some if it may well be because Chrome to this day (Version 93) still disables GPU accelerated video decode by default.\n To check it for yourself, go to chrome://gpu/ - if everything there is green for you, great! You can stop reading this post.\n If you, like me, find both \"Video Decode\" and \"Rasterization\" to be \"Software only\" and want to change that, keep reading. I noticed most of the \"Problems Detected\" are more than a decade old and even stem from the fglrx driver. So just because AMD had terrible drivers in the past, Chrome still plays it safe and does not touch hardware acceleration to avoid breaking some fringe configuration!\n But MESA drivers are pretty good now, let's get rid of that blacklist:\n  \nEnable the Hardware Accelerated Video Decode flag in chrome://flags/#enable-accelerated-video-decode\n Enable Vulkan rendering in chrome://flags/#enable-vulkan\n close Chrome, start it with google-chrome --use-gl=desktop --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecoder You can edit your launcher settings to always include those parameters\n  \nNow check chrome://gpu/ again. If everything went right, you should see a lot of green there now. Video decode should now use a lot less of your CPU. YouTube will typically server you VP9 or AV1 video for which only the very latest hardware has hardware support. If you rely on hardware video decode either because you are on an old machine or you want to maximize battery life, the h264ify extension would force the use of H.264 streams.

Every time I used Linux, there would ALWAYS be something that would go wrong, usually hardware driver related that led to endless googling, then I just gave up as I don't have the time nor am I in that particular line of work.\n Anyway, I'm lucky I bought a Dell XPS 9370 several years ago. I installed Zorin OS and low and behold, brand new laptop (operates much cooler, and the coil whine seems to have disappeared funnily enough).\n Thankfully, everything works out the box (except the fingerprint sensor, I can't get that to work, if anyone can point me in the right direction that would be great, but it's not a deal breaker).\n So after installing Zorin on an encrypted partition over my old windows hd (complete wipe), I have a fully functional Linux OS that pretty much works (finally after many years!!).\n I accidently stumbled upon LTT's YouTube video in which he talks about Steam, I thought am I hearing this right?? After downloading and installing Steam, I am able to load up AAA titles on my LINUX OS!!??!!!!. I cannot believe my eyes. When did this happen? My research indicates its using a modified version of Wine (designated Proton).\n I haven't tested it yet on my new Dell XPS 9790 (RTX 2060 MaxQ). Hopefully Zorin (Ubuntu base LTS 20.04) is compatible with this gpu, as I want to wipe W10 from my new machine and install Linux exclusively with a W10 vm.\n A big congratulations to the Linux community for achieving major milestones without any help from Microsoft.\n ‚Äã\n Edit: I'm getting downvoted by some scrotums for simply congratulating and thanking the Linux community for outputting some amazing accomplishments.

So I decided to create this program which in the end turned out to have these 2 features that are mentioned above and a lot more. Some of the features are :\n  \nCounting the existing documents and files with the passed string sequence in their names\n Listing the existing documents and files with the passed string sequence in their names\n Displaying details and info on the documents with the passed string sequence in their names\n Opening the founded document or file with the passed string sequence in it's name using your favorite application \n  \nAnd of course a lot more, like alphabetical sorting, reversing the results and outputting a colorful results...\n I really hope that it's useful for some of the folks out there in the Linux community :)\n    submitted by    /u/yan_kh  \n [link]   [comments]",

He said that we should instead try to play with our input settings. Too bad they have no effect on the scroll speed difference between Chromium and e.g. Firefox.\n This unwanted behavior has been confirmed and discussed by so many people throughout the years (see the Chromium issue, issues from Electron apps, issues from Brave browser, reviews for the many extensions trying to solve the problem).\n I have tried the Linux Scroll Speed Fix extension but it disables the smooth scrolling and has some issues (e.g. PDFs, iframes, smooth scrolling through css is laggy). Also, it obviously has no effect on Electron apps.\n I think this issue is a deal breaker considering it effects so many apps - not only the browser. It makes the Linux ecosystem less attractive, especially if you get recommended to \"play with the input settings\" (this has nothing to do with playing). So many people are asking for a simple and user-friendly solution.\n In my opinion Chromium should provide an interface to set the scroll speed (for Electron) and a user-friendly setting in the browser where you can set the scroll speed. What do you think about it and how can we draw more attention to this issue?\n    submitted by    /u/QuickTurtle9  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have recently decided to come back to Linux full time on my machines and ditch the Apple ecosystem altogether.\n Let me just say Linux on the desktop has polished up so much since I‚Äôve been away. It‚Äôs amazing. I practically have an alternative app or an equivalent app for all of my work flows. The only exception is firewall.\n On MacOS I lived by an app called little snitch which would let you block connections to and from your machine on a per application basis. It was great because I could allow safari access to the internet, but block things like the notes app, or Microsoft word.\n Does anyone know a good alternative for Linux ? I‚Äôve heard of opensnitch but idk if it‚Äôs still actively developed anymore and I‚Äôve had troubles getting it installed and working properly. My end goal is to block all internet connections except for the apps and services I chose to allow.\n    submitted by    /u/Lechap0  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can now change your GTK and Kvantum themes from the same app with ease. This app has also other various features, like GTK CSS editing with instantaneous preview in the app. This app works well for me, a user of a tiling WM, but the app is definitely not fully done; there are various features that I would like to add.\n This is my first kinda serious open-source undertaking, and I hope this will work out well.

For a company such as Sony or Nintendo to \"reinvent the wheel\" by writing a new OS from scratch every time a new console is being developed seems to be a waste of resources. I'm not mentioning mikrosoft since they have Windows to use as a base for Xbox.\n By using something like Debian, Arch, RHEL, game companies can save time by not having to write a new OS all over again. The only issue I can see with this approach is that any modified GPL licensed code would have to be re-released under the same license and it seems that big companies are not fond of the GPL for that reason (to keep any changes to the original code private).\n Anywho, these vast array of distributions and frameworks nowadays make it silly for Sony or Nintendo to start from scratch every time they want to make a new console.\n  \nNote: This thread is getting so many replies.

I have peace of mind with it, even tho it is prorpietary software that could potentially be snooping around my system, and I have no proof to prove or deny that, but for some reason I feel like it's different with it.\n Does this happen to you? Why might it be? Maybe because of Valve's attitude towards Linux? Maybe because they are not in the advertising industry?\n    submitted by    /u/SnooPets20  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's really brought back an old pentium laptop from my school days that my father was going to dump in the trash plus my mom is able to use it easily so I am very happy with that.\n I really like some of the User interface in Zorin lite so I then looked at Zorin OS 16 and it seems even better. So now I am considering whether I should jump from Ubuntu to Zorin or not. Being a software developer, the vast availability of repositories and applications available to Ubuntu compared to Zorin is the only reason I haven't made that switch\n I was hoping to get insight from people whether they would switch from Ubuntu to Zorin and if they wouldn't, why not?

It works on other laptops too except the asusctl part.\n This script is very useful for laptop users who have to setup lots of things after installing gnu/linux. Asus users can use the asusctl option for automated install of asusctl which gives them full control over fans,rgb and graphic card switching.\n Asusctl does alot more stuff too. U can find more about it here: asusctl\n It also has an option for installing pulseeffects presets automatically which i found very tiring to do.\n Currently the script supports Pacman,Zypper,Apt and Dnf.\n ‚Äã\n I hope this helps someone .\n    submitted by    /u/drunkcj  \n [link]   [comments]",

Back then it was impossible to download a full distro because of my slow internet connection. \n I had to buy SuSE Linux in the box with CDs and books inside (‚Ç¨89.90 in 2003 - not that cheap at the time). \n Looking back, that distro feels quite primitive while it was considered among the best and user friendly! \n A few months later (perhaps early 2004), I bought the book \"RH Linux & Fedora Unleashed\" which included a DVD with the full Fedora Core (first release ever). This was far superior compared to SuSE 8.2\n I was quite a geeky kid and by my ealy teens I was able to write code in many languages, including an attempt to code in Z80 assembly on my Amstrad CPC 6128 around mid/late '80s. \n Over the years, and with the domination of Windows, my passion for computing deteriorated. Even though I would say that \"I loved windows 95/98,\" I may have been disappointed by the lack of fascinating technologies from anyone other than Wintel.\n Linux (re)opened a whole world for me. Not least because of its free/libre nature but also about the transparency of everything. Code transparency is translated into user/developer choice from the shallowest to the deepest level of any technology - don't forget that all developers are users too. \n I have been using GNU/Linux (various distros) exclusively at home and in my professional setting, where the choice is exclusively mine, for the last 15 years. I have to use windows for the companies that I work for and even there, I have the choice to work on my personal computers on some projects. \n A big, HUGE THANK YOU to all the people who have made this wonderful computing world a reality for all the geeky kids (or gen-Xer in my case) like us!\n    submitted by    /u/trivialBetaState  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems like I am always trying to fix or resolve something on Linux just to get basic functionality.\n I used Linux Mint for 4 years, but after an annoying bug where my window snapping would have an off by 1 error, I moved to Kubuntu Plasma.\n Both of these distros would not reliably wake the monitor. Suspending, logging out, switching users, waking from suspend/monitor off have been nothing but issues for me....the entire time I have been on linux.\n At first I used an Nvidia card, and everyone at KDE was like \"Use AMD, its so much better\"....so I tried AMD. I am running an RX580 video card, which is as mainstream AMD as you could get....still tonnes of issues. It freezes when I switch users periodically. I just tried to wake my computer and the monitor was black......and I have suspend and power off monitor disabled (wtf?).\n It seems like for every bug that is fixed in KDE Plasma, a new one is created, and I really don't look forward or have hope for any new version.\n I honestly have come to the conclusion that it is just not worth it. My hobby is not my OS, and as someone who just wants to live a stress free life and get things done, I just don't think Linux is for me.

          "description": "I recently switched to an Arch-based distro and honestly it's the best UX I've come across of all distros I've used before. \n  \nThe AUR is the best thing since sliced bread. With an AUR package manger (e.g. I use yay) you can install almost any popular app out there with a single command. Installing stuff like Joplin, Intellij IDE's, Spotify, discord, filezilla, and tonnes of others is such a pleasure compared to the install procedures on other distros. If you're lucky you get a .deb you can install on a Debian-based distro, but usually you have to extract tarballs and set up .desktop files yourself, which is such a hassle. Not to mention manually managing updates.\n The Arch wiki is my savior. Pretty much every issue I've come across since installing has had a dedicated Arch wiki page with well-written instructions on how to fix the problem. I haven't seen similar user-friendly and in-depth wikis for other distros. \n  \nSure things get a little hacky at times, especially if you're installing from the command line. But for Linux beginners an Arch-derivative with a GUI installer serves up a dream situation.\n    submitted by    /u/gaussian_distro  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use an Asus Rog so the scripts works perfectly for it. It works on other laptops too except the asusctl part.\n This script is very useful for laptop users who have to setup lots of things after installing gnu/linux. Asus users can use the asusctl option for automated install of asusctl which gives them full control over fans,rgb and graphic card switching. \n Asusctl does alot more stuff too. U can find more about it here: asusctl\n It also has an option for installing pulseeffects presets automatically which i found very tiring to do.\n Currently the script supports Pacman,Zypper,Apt and Dnf.\n ‚Äã\n Please contact me if you find any issue or have any suggestions for me.\n ‚Äã\n I hope this helps someone .\n    submitted by    /u/drunkcj  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey All:\n I do a lot of distro hopping, and every time I reinstall a new distribution I have to reinstall and re-setup x11vnc so I can use my phone to control my computer when I am away. I got tired to doing it manual every time so I wrote this quick little script that automates the process for me. Thought I would just share it here in case anyone else is in the same boat.\n This script thus far has only been tested on Linux Mint running Cinnamon, but I would imagine it would work on any Ubuntu based distribution. I did test trying to run x11vnc on OpenSUSE, but I could never get it to work properly.\n Feel free to edit, update, or even make your own script off this. There are probably already a thousand different scripts like this in existence, but was it one of the characters in Startcraft II that said \"This is my C-14 Impaler gauss rifle! There are many like it, but this one is mine!\"\n https://github.com/BeholdenCypress/BashScripts/blob/main/x11vnc_install.sh\n P.S. Was not sure which flair to use, so sorry if it is the wrong one. Let me know which one I should've used and I will change it.\n    submitted by    /u/Beh0ldenCypress  \n [link]   [comments]",
