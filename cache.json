All the actions and the binary files are installed in /opt/bin.\n Usage\n appman [option] or appman [option] [argument]\n where option include:\n -h , help Print this message.\n -a [argument], about [argument] Show basic info on each application, link to the website and/or the source and how to update some applications.\n -c, clean Remove all unnecessary files and folders, i.e. backup files, installation scripts, and temporary folders zip or deb packages.\n -f, files Programs installed on the system.\n -i [argument], install [argument] Install a program. It can be used to update... non-updatable programs too (see -u, update).\n -l, list Shows the list of apps available in the repository.\n -r [argument], remove [argument] Removes a program (requires confirmation, default is N).\n -s, sync Updates the list of available apps.\n -u, update Update AppImages using 'appimageupdate', if the update info is embedded into the AppImage itself by the developer.\n The link to the repository is this: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan\n The list of available apps is here, I've also provided some templates for you to modify the way you like (here).

I used Ubuntu back then, thought GNOME was slow and awful, and switched to XFCE instead. \n However, as WEP went away and WPA looked like more of an effort to crack (dictionary attacks look like they took too long), I stopped using Linux and haven't really touched it since. \n Recently though, I decided to give Linux a spin after hearing news about the Steam Deck and how SteamOS is switching to Arch.

In addition to this there has been a large number of contributions from our users who have been actively working with the pre-release versions to test it, make sure it works in the real world and with a large array of different applications and reporting their results. I am also delighted to note that there has been a 94% increase in the amount of documentation that we have since OpenSSL 1.1.1 and an (adjusted) increase in the “lines of code” in our tests of 54%. There has never been a better demonstration of what an active and enthusiastic community we have than when you look at the statistics for the OpenSSL 3.0 development work.

          "description": "Disclaimer: This enables a feature that is disabled by default, if you are experiencing render issues make sure to remember how to turn in off again!\n I have an AMD GPU that uses the amdgpu driver, if you are not using MESA drivers your experience may vary!\n Some people are experiencing shorter battery life / worse performance when browsing the Web on Linux. Some if it may well be because Chrome to this day (Version 93) still disables GPU accelerated video decode by default.\n To check it for yourself, go to chrome://gpu/ - if everything there is green for you, great! You can stop reading this post.\n If you, like me, find both \"Video Decode\" and \"Rasterization\" to be \"Software only\" and want to change that, keep reading. I noticed most of the \"Problems Detected\" are more than a decade old and even stem from the fglrx driver. So just because AMD had terrible drivers in the past, Chrome still plays it safe and does not touch hardware acceleration to avoid breaking some fringe configuration!\n But MESA drivers are pretty good now, let's get rid of that blacklist:\n  \nEnable the Hardware Accelerated Video Decode flag in chrome://flags/#enable-accelerated-video-decode\n Enable Vulkan rendering in chrome://flags/#enable-vulkan\n close Chrome, start it with google-chrome --use-gl=desktop --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecoder You can edit your launcher settings to always include those parameters\n  \nNow check chrome://gpu/ again. If everything went right, you should see a lot of green there now. Video decode should now use a lot less of your CPU. YouTube will typically server you VP9 or AV1 video for which only the very latest hardware has hardware support. If you rely on hardware video decode either because you are on an old machine or you want to maximize battery life, the h264ify extension would force the use of H.264 streams.

Every time I used Linux, there would ALWAYS be something that would go wrong, usually hardware driver related that led to endless googling, then I just gave up as I don't have the time nor am I in that particular line of work.\n Anyway, I'm lucky I bought a Dell XPS 9370 several years ago. I installed Zorin OS and low and behold, brand new laptop (operates much cooler, and the coil whine seems to have disappeared funnily enough).\n Thankfully, everything works out the box (except the fingerprint sensor, I can't get that to work, if anyone can point me in the right direction that would be great, but it's not a deal breaker).\n So after installing Zorin on an encrypted partition over my old windows hd (complete wipe), I have a fully functional Linux OS that pretty much works (finally after many years!!).\n I accidently stumbled upon LTT's YouTube video in which he talks about Steam, I thought am I hearing this right?? After downloading and installing Steam, I am able to load up AAA titles on my LINUX OS!!??!!!!. I cannot believe my eyes. When did this happen? My research indicates its using a modified version of Wine (designated Proton).\n I haven't tested it yet on my new Dell XPS 9790 (RTX 2060 MaxQ). Hopefully Zorin (Ubuntu base LTS 20.04) is compatible with this gpu, as I want to wipe W10 from my new machine and install Linux exclusively with a W10 vm.\n A big congratulations to the Linux community for achieving major milestones without any help from Microsoft.\n ​\n Edit: I'm getting downvoted by some scrotums for simply congratulating and thanking the Linux community for outputting some amazing accomplishments.

So I decided to create this program which in the end turned out to have these 2 features that are mentioned above and a lot more. Some of the features are :\n  \nCounting the existing documents and files with the passed string sequence in their names\n Listing the existing documents and files with the passed string sequence in their names\n Displaying details and info on the documents with the passed string sequence in their names\n Opening the founded document or file with the passed string sequence in it's name using your favorite application \n  \nAnd of course a lot more, like alphabetical sorting, reversing the results and outputting a colorful results...\n I really hope that it's useful for some of the folks out there in the Linux community :)\n    submitted by    /u/yan_kh  \n [link]   [comments]",

He said that we should instead try to play with our input settings. Too bad they have no effect on the scroll speed difference between Chromium and e.g. Firefox.\n This unwanted behavior has been confirmed and discussed by so many people throughout the years (see the Chromium issue, issues from Electron apps, issues from Brave browser, reviews for the many extensions trying to solve the problem).\n I have tried the Linux Scroll Speed Fix extension but it disables the smooth scrolling and has some issues (e.g. PDFs, iframes, smooth scrolling through css is laggy). Also, it obviously has no effect on Electron apps.\n I think this issue is a deal breaker considering it effects so many apps - not only the browser. It makes the Linux ecosystem less attractive, especially if you get recommended to \"play with the input settings\" (this has nothing to do with playing). So many people are asking for a simple and user-friendly solution.\n In my opinion Chromium should provide an interface to set the scroll speed (for Electron) and a user-friendly setting in the browser where you can set the scroll speed.

I have recently decided to come back to Linux full time on my machines and ditch the Apple ecosystem altogether.\n Let me just say Linux on the desktop has polished up so much since I’ve been away. It’s amazing. I practically have an alternative app or an equivalent app for all of my work flows. The only exception is firewall.\n On MacOS I lived by an app called little snitch which would let you block connections to and from your machine on a per application basis. It was great because I could allow safari access to the internet, but block things like the notes app, or Microsoft word.\n Does anyone know a good alternative for Linux ? I’ve heard of opensnitch but idk if it’s still actively developed anymore and I’ve had troubles getting it installed and working properly. My end goal is to block all internet connections except for the apps and services I chose to allow.\n    submitted by    /u/Lechap0  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can now change your GTK and Kvantum themes from the same app with ease. This app has also other various features, like GTK CSS editing with instantaneous preview in the app. This app works well for me, a user of a tiling WM, but the app is definitely not fully done; there are various features that I would like to add.\n This is my first kinda serious open-source undertaking, and I hope this will work out well.

For a company such as Sony or Nintendo to \"reinvent the wheel\" by writing a new OS from scratch every time a new console is being developed seems to be a waste of resources. I'm not mentioning mikrosoft since they have Windows to use as a base for Xbox.\n By using something like Debian, Arch, RHEL, game companies can save time by not having to write a new OS all over again. The only issue I can see with this approach is that any modified GPL licensed code would have to be re-released under the same license and it seems that big companies are not fond of the GPL for that reason (to keep any changes to the original code private).\n Anywho, these vast array of distributions and frameworks nowadays make it silly for Sony or Nintendo to start from scratch every time they want to make a new console.\n  \nNote: This thread is getting so many replies.

I'm kind of paranoid, I always belive they are snooping around my system or doing shady things, so I try to avoid proprietary software as much as possible (and apart from games, nearly all software in my system is open-source).\n For some reason tho, I don't get that feeling with Steam. I have peace of mind with it, even tho it is prorpietary software that could potentially be snooping around my system, and I have no proof to prove or deny that, but for some reason I feel like it's different with it.\n Does this happen to you? Why might it be? Maybe because of Valve's attitude towards Linux? Maybe because they are not in the advertising industry?\n    submitted by    /u/SnooPets20  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's really brought back an old pentium laptop from my school days that my father was going to dump in the trash plus my mom is able to use it easily so I am very happy with that.\n I really like some of the User interface in Zorin lite so I then looked at Zorin OS 16 and it seems even better. So now I am considering whether I should jump from Ubuntu to Zorin or not. Being a software developer, the vast availability of repositories and applications available to Ubuntu compared to Zorin is the only reason I haven't made that switch\n I was hoping to get insight from people whether they would switch from Ubuntu to Zorin and if they wouldn't, why not?

I use an Asus Rog so the scripts works perfectly for it. It works on other laptops too except the asusctl part.\n This script is very useful for laptop users who have to setup lots of things after installing gnu/linux. Asus users can use the asusctl option for automated install of asusctl which gives them full control over fans,rgb and graphic card switching.\n Asusctl does alot more stuff too. U can find more about it here: asusctl\n It also has an option for installing pulseeffects presets automatically which i found very tiring to do.\n Currently the script supports Pacman,Zypper,Apt and Dnf.\n ​\n I hope this helps someone .\n    submitted by    /u/drunkcj  \n [link]   [comments]",

Back then it was impossible to download a full distro because of my slow internet connection. \n I had to buy SuSE Linux in the box with CDs and books inside (€89.90 in 2003 - not that cheap at the time). \n Looking back, that distro feels quite primitive while it was considered among the best and user friendly! \n A few months later (perhaps early 2004), I bought the book \"RH Linux & Fedora Unleashed\" which included a DVD with the full Fedora Core (first release ever). This was far superior compared to SuSE 8.2\n I was quite a geeky kid and by my ealy teens I was able to write code in many languages, including an attempt to code in Z80 assembly on my Amstrad CPC 6128 around mid/late '80s. \n Over the years, and with the domination of Windows, my passion for computing deteriorated. Even though I would say that \"I loved windows 95/98,\" I may have been disappointed by the lack of fascinating technologies from anyone other than Wintel.\n Linux (re)opened a whole world for me. Not least because of its free/libre nature but also about the transparency of everything. Code transparency is translated into user/developer choice from the shallowest to the deepest level of any technology - don't forget that all developers are users too. \n I have been using GNU/Linux (various distros) exclusively at home and in my professional setting, where the choice is exclusively mine, for the last 15 years. I have to use windows for the companies that I work for and even there, I have the choice to work on my personal computers on some projects. \n A big, HUGE THANK YOU to all the people who have made this wonderful computing world a reality for all the geeky kids (or gen-Xer in my case) like us!\n    submitted by    /u/trivialBetaState  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems like I am always trying to fix or resolve something on Linux just to get basic functionality.\n I used Linux Mint for 4 years, but after an annoying bug where my window snapping would have an off by 1 error, I moved to Kubuntu Plasma.\n Both of these distros would not reliably wake the monitor. Suspending, logging out, switching users, waking from suspend/monitor off have been nothing but issues for me....the entire time I have been on linux.\n At first I used an Nvidia card, and everyone at KDE was like \"Use AMD, its so much better\"....so I tried AMD. I am running an RX580 video card, which is as mainstream AMD as you could get....still tonnes of issues. It freezes when I switch users periodically. I just tried to wake my computer and the monitor was black......and I have suspend and power off monitor disabled (wtf?).\n It seems like for every bug that is fixed in KDE Plasma, a new one is created, and I really don't look forward or have hope for any new version.\n I honestly have come to the conclusion that it is just not worth it. My hobby is not my OS, and as someone who just wants to live a stress free life and get things done, I just don't think Linux is for me.

          "description": "I recently switched to an Arch-based distro and honestly it's the best UX I've come across of all distros I've used before. \n  \nThe AUR is the best thing since sliced bread. With an AUR package manger (e.g. I use yay) you can install almost any popular app out there with a single command. Installing stuff like Joplin, Intellij IDE's, Spotify, discord, filezilla, and tonnes of others is such a pleasure compared to the install procedures on other distros. If you're lucky you get a .deb you can install on a Debian-based distro, but usually you have to extract tarballs and set up .desktop files yourself, which is such a hassle. Not to mention manually managing updates.\n The Arch wiki is my savior. Pretty much every issue I've come across since installing has had a dedicated Arch wiki page with well-written instructions on how to fix the problem. I haven't seen similar user-friendly and in-depth wikis for other distros. \n  \nSure things get a little hacky at times, especially if you're installing from the command line. But for Linux beginners an Arch-derivative with a GUI installer serves up a dream situation.\n    submitted by    /u/gaussian_distro  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use an Asus Rog so the scripts works perfectly for it. It works on other laptops too except the asusctl part.\n This script is very useful for laptop users who have to setup lots of things after installing gnu/linux. Asus users can use the asusctl option for automated install of asusctl which gives them full control over fans,rgb and graphic card switching. \n Asusctl does alot more stuff too. U can find more about it here: asusctl\n It also has an option for installing pulseeffects presets automatically which i found very tiring to do.\n Currently the script supports Pacman,Zypper,Apt and Dnf.\n ​\n Please contact me if you find any issue or have any suggestions for me.\n ​\n I hope this helps someone .\n    submitted by    /u/drunkcj  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got tired to doing it manual every time so I wrote this quick little script that automates the process for me. Thought I would just share it here in case anyone else is in the same boat.\n This script thus far has only been tested on Linux Mint running Cinnamon, but I would imagine it would work on any Ubuntu based distribution. I did test trying to run x11vnc on OpenSUSE, but I could never get it to work properly.\n Feel free to edit, update, or even make your own script off this. There are probably already a thousand different scripts like this in existence, but was it one of the characters in Startcraft II that said \"This is my C-14 Impaler gauss rifle! There are many like it, but this one is mine!\"\n https://github.com/BeholdenCypress/BashScripts/blob/main/x11vnc_install.sh\n P.S. Was not sure which flair to use, so sorry if it is the wrong one.

Problem is it was abandoned since 2017. \n A year and a ton of hard work from myself and many other people, and not only did we fix so many problems that it had, but added many more features. The latest being blueprints similar to python flask, and a better JSON implementation (although it's still far from perfect).\n I tried to make the whole platform more user friendly by adding in code documentation, guides, and a landing page to advertise the framework.\n I also did some simple benchmarks (mostly based on criteria set by TechEmpowered) and the results (I had to extrapolate them because I was running the tests locally on my personal machine) showed great potential, to the level where Crow would saturate a 10gbps connection at 70% performance.\n I'm making this post to let people know that if they're looking to run their own web service or upgrade an existing one that Crow might be a viable framework for them. I apologize if this isn't the right place or I misunderstood the rules in any way.\n    submitted by    /u/the_edev  \n [link]   [comments]",

Software for Linux is being distributed for Linux as containers such as flatpaks, appimages, etc. or as straight binaries but the documentation that come with these formats in very limited or non-existent. I've also not seen any applications distributed this way contain man pages.\n That's not to say that I'm against containerized applications. I'm, not. I'm a great proponent of appimages in particular. I think that could be a great way to bring back awesome software that is no longer compatible with current Linux distros because the dependencies have been dropped. However, I find that it's assumed that documentation will be on a website somewhere instead of on the system with the software. I think there could/should be a middle ground where you have your containerized or binary-only packages but also full documentation with it in the form of man pages or some other easy to use format.\n    submitted by    /u/Capitan_Picard  \n [link]   [comments]",

Why buy an OS from some foreign megacorp, and be at the whim of their profit-motivated choices, when you can tailor your own system to your own needs, have full localization of language, standards, norms... and invite the citizens to participate themselves in giving feedback, cotributing to it, building it up, etc. They can organize armies, collect taxes, run ports, enforce laws, etc, on their own. Some of them have National Churches, National Healthcare Systems, National Education Systems. Truly enormous and outstanding organizations. I can't imagine why they wouldn't make and run their own publicly-supported, free-at-the-point-of-purchase, open-source OS? \n Hell, France had even come up with their own \"internet\" standard at one point, the Minitel.

I use Windows mostly for when I feel like producing music using Reaper (which I hear can run in WINE, not sure about plugin support), or playing the odd video game here and there.\n **Main question:**\n What are the drawbacks of these methods? In my mind, I assume I can keep my Linux processes running using the onboard GPU provided by the processor chip while giving my Windows VM access to my NVIDIA card so I can run... video games, photoshop, and other Windows software\n Is it a hassle to set up and maintain? I don't mind fiddling with settings a bit, as long as it isn't ungodly hard to make compatible. I wonder if I would have a lot of issues with my PC crashing or the VM not being able to access my graphics card consistently.\n Any thoughts/comments are welcome :D I've only done light research, but it sounds like a good idea\n    submitted by    /u/alienz0mbie  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I assume that setting the nodev, noexec, etc options on a folder would require that it's a seperate filesystem or logical volume so it makes separating those a requirement?\n ​\n If I go that route I end up with 10 separate volumes with seems somewhat excessive.\n ​\n /boot\n /boot/efi\n /\n /home\n /tmp\n /var\n /var/log\n /var/log/audit\n /var/tmp\n SWAP\n ​\n How practical would having that many seperate volumes be in a production non federal information system environment?

          "description": "I need to get some desktop systems up and running whose main purpose are to run a bunch of virtual machines, so I need all the spare ram I can get. I've been unhappy with the ram usage of Mate and XFCE, and they offer a bunch of stuff we don't necessarily need anyway, so I've been looking for a window manager that's lighter.\n However I've encountered a major problem. It seems that like 95% of these projects are dead and haven't seen any updates in 5-15 years, and the other 5% that are alive act like they tripped and fell out of 1998. They don't support HiDPI monitors, they don't support asian/middle eastern languages or emoji, they have no ability to graphically configure any options or preferences, half of them don't even come with a taskbar, etc. (And that's not even touching on how they look ugly as sin).\n Is there any option out there that was designed this millennia? Something that can be used on modern hardware by normal office workers in an international setting?\n edit: Also I forgot to mention that this needs to be a floating/stacking window manager, ones that are tiling-only won't work for our use case.\n    submitted by    /u/sneakertech  \n [link]   [comments]",
